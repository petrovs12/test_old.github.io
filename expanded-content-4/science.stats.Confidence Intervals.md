 In a frequentist setting, confidence intervals can be taken from the MLE + CLT via the identity:

 $P(-z_{\alpha/2}<\sqrt(I(\theta)*(\hat{\theta}-\theta)) < z_{\alpha/2})\approx 1-\alpha$

 Where $z_{alpha}$ is the $1-\alpha$- th quantile of the standard normal distribution:

$z_{\alpha} = \Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha)$,
that is:

$P_{x\approx N(0,1)}(x>z_{alpha})=\alpha$
