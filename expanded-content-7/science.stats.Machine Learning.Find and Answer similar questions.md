Many people use groups every day they use these groups to ask and answer questions. However, unfortunately, like the search in this group is not perfect and there might be question duplicate or might be related questions there also might be people we want to prompt who based on the previous activity and might be a good good person to try to answer this particular question how would you design such system so so that you can find an answer for similar questions in the group?
 

 so this is a general. This is a general kind of search question rather just leave it to this is basically a general question just basically limited on the main so I can imagine a front representation bar user type a new question and results are showing similar questions and we believe the be so we can discuss OK off-line how do we identify questions and answers of high-quality groups that can be used as knowledge source so basically how do we choose? How do we wait it down? What is the objective function then it's an index in retrieval questions or maybe we go with the bedding and retrieve their also also identification how do I do? We identify answers so we could have a button which is called Mark answer we can use also as proxy like something that has many likes or likes or engagement by the particular ask of the question confidence estimation I would like the question answer are relevant to each other should be proposed to post any question that in which group and beyond just texture that we obviously have everything else you can think of"


 are relevant to each other should be proposed to post any question that in which group and beyond just texture that we obviously have everything else you can think of.
