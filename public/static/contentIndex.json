Power = 1 - Type II error.\nsample_size \\approx \\frac{16\\sigma^2}{\\tau^2} where \\tau is the effect size (difference in the metric chosen between the control and treatment group).\nAs we don’t know \\tau, we can choose the minimal detectable effect size, equal to the minimal business-relevant effect size, i.e. the min effect that would justify a switch.\nNormally decided by stakeholders.\nMultiple Testing Problems\nBayesian setup, Bonferroni correction, or something else.\nBonferroni correction:\ndivide significance level by the number of tests.\nBut sometimes too conservative, i.e. lower recall\nOr can control False Discovery Rate.\nFDR = E[\\frac{falsePositives}{rejectiosn}].\nThis can be calculated, then choose a threshold for FDR, etc.\nIn a decision-making setup, can optimize the above…\nNovelty and Primacy Effect\nUser behavior can either be resistent to change, or welcoming it, and we don’t know apriori.\nIf the effect is initially large up/down and then gets closer to the baseline, this is the novelty/primacy effect.\nRun Longer\nUse Only New Users (or equivalent type matching)\nCan fix by running experiments on new users, or having the baseline be the behavior or new users when they were new, etc. In the latter case should maybe control for seasonality or other temporal effects as appropriate.\nInterference between variants\nHappens most often when control and treatment groups interact somehow.\nIf they interact like a ‘standard’ network effect (not competing for resources), we expect the actual effect to be larger than during the test.\nExample FB posts promote more posts, so if small increase in population, will get larger.\nscience.math.Game Theory.Agent Based Models\nTransclude of science.math.Game-Theory.Agent-Based-Models#^fbepidemology\nIf 2-sided market, control and treatment groups compete for same resource. If we give better ‘weapon’ for treatment, after launch it would disappear, as everyone has better “weapon”.\nExample Better matching algo for Uber drivers. (or in the extreme case, prioritize some drivers over others- obviously the treatment group is more priviliged).\nIsolation of effect\nTest between “connected components”, e.g. New York vs LA (approximately, of course). Also can do temporally etc.\nSimplest is geographical splits.\nIn social network:\ntest on differennt ‘clusters’ of people.\nEgo-network randomization. A more scalable variation of the above.\nAB testing for science.stats.Regression.Ranking\nengineering.system_design.ML System Design.Recommender Systems\nPlease also see ^ranking-start.\nComparing two rankings via clicks.\nSay 2 algorithms give 2 rankings, Ranking A, ranking B.\nMerge-sort-remove-duplicates interleaving the rankings.\nAssign first element randomly.\nCount clicks from A and B.
