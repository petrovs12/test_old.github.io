Notes from 2nd chapter of **The Product Book**.

# Why does the company exist?

[Start with Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4&ab_channel=TED)
There's a book as well.

## _Why_  is guiding light

If the product is told as a story, **why** is the theme.  

What is the story about?

**Mission Statement**

**why->how->what**

Start with raison d'etre, then figure out how it would be achieved, and finally **what** to build.

#NB The order of **how** and **what** in this context is different than when thinking aobut requirements and implementation details.

### Apple examples:

- If starting with 'what :“We make great computers. They’re user-friendly, beautifully designed, and
  easy to use. Want to buy one?” That’s fine, but it sounds pretty generic.
  Many other PC manufacturers even make the same claim!

- if starting with 'why': “With
  everything we do, we aim to challenge the status quo. We aim to think
  differently. Our products are user-friendly, beautifully designed, and easy
  to use. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one?

The 2nd one is supposedly more useful to guide product decisions.

# Bad Missions

## Revenue goal

Company would fail, cause it's backwards. You bring value and then get the revenue. Goal is to make customer awesome.

### Revenue is a Validation/Metric

Not a goal by itself.

## Solution looking for a problem

 Companies that start not with a mission, but some invention they're trying to sell, would have a harder time.
 By itself an invention is not a product- products are solutions to problems people encounter.

 'Pivoting' often happens in such cases, as a company tries to repurpose whatever it has built in order to find customers who will buy it.

## No mission statement

Such company could be moderately successful, but may be hard to grow, as it's not clear what the product line is about. 

Thus subsequent products may feel disjointed, may start to solve too many different problems, etc.

For many of the in the [[seed.Product Management.Strategic Understanding of The Company#^5C]] analysis you wouldn't be able to produce specific enough answers.

### **Figure out at least a common implicit/latent value proposition.**

If we have some products that are hitting, we can cobble together a mission statement ad-hoc by looking at a common value proposition/theme/etc.

Misfit example w/ wearables.

# [[seed.Product Management.Target Customers]] and  [[seed.Product Management.Personas]]

# Personas

![[seed.Product Management.Personas]]

# Adopter Curve

<div class="mermaid">
  graph LR;
a[Investors]--&gt;b[Early Adopters]--Adoption gap--&gt;d[Early Majority]--&gt;e[Late Majority]--&gt;f[Laggards]
</div>

Must jump over adoption gap before being able to get mass market adoption

# Make Realistic Personas, get under their skin

Common mistake is to define personas 90% by demography, 10% by wants/needs/emotions.

Imagine a persona, say Jill, who's thinkuing about buying her first car.

What does she care about? Fuel efficiency? Up-front cost? New/used? Making a statement? Does Jill enjoy the research process or just wants to be pointed at the right direction?

How deep does she go while comparing things?  

## Anti-Pattern: 3d glasses for home cinema

3D movies performed well, but at-home watching experience is more of a social activity than crowded and darkened theater.

Thus, the 3D glasses are goofy and party-pooper.

Put yourself in the place of the **persona**, empathising deeply.

# Use Cases

Definition:
How would the **persona** use the product to achieve a goal?

A sufficiently detailed answer of that question is a **use case**.

# Enterprise vs Consumers

Key difference between an enterprise-centric and consumer-centric product is that in enterprise, the buyer and user are different personas. 

Historically, B2C was more focused on UI, as this is not people's job and they should be onboarded as painlessly as possible.

For B2B, functionality has been more important. However, now B2B products also pay a lot of attention to the user experience.

B2B has more complex needs: additional legal requirements, multiuser environments and so on.
E.g. on-premise solutions vs cloud, different security things, licensing, etc.

# How to measure if product is good

Task success, [[seed.Product Management.Product Metrics]]

# Vanity Metrics vs Actionable

 Some metrics can be Investor BS. For example, monthly active users (who in reality just log in and out).

## Measuring Metrics

[[engineering.Google Analytics]]

## Net Promoter score,e tc

Survey and ask 'how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?'

Remove 'typical scores'. Call people of high scores 'promoters' and people of low scores 'detractors'.

$NPC = \frac{numPromoters-numDetractors}{TotalVoters}$

## What's the rest of product portfolio

## Roadmap

## Competition and Climate

# Company Context ^5C

5C:

- Company
- Customers
- Collaborators
- Competitors
- Culture/Climate - macroeconomics or cultural things that are current
