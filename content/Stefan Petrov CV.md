, I am a Quantitative Engineer and Data Scientist, specializing in Machine Learning, AI, Statistics, and Operations research. I like taking on challenging problems and solving them in a way that's logically and mathematically sound, agrees with the data, and adds business value. I've been leading a team for several years and participating in company-wide decision-making. I'm comfortable both as an individual contributor and in a leadership role.

- Applied **Stochastic Optimization** for routing, network design, and  warehouse optimization, inventory management, asset allocation. Benefits recognized by a **client-published press releases, attributing of 7% cost reduction** of fleet operations to the partnership.
    

- Gathering and analysis of **business requirements, project scoping, and planning of all aspects**. Result and impact presentation. 

- Estimation of value-added by our products w/ counterfactual analysis. Participation in pre-sales and product development.
    

- Used neural net, probabilistic programming, survival analysis, and Convex Optimization for estimation of parameters in complex business processes, for which out-of-the-box methods are not appropriate. Examples: data editing and imputation, highly unbalanced time series, predictive maintenance, dynamic pricing, order matching. 
    

- Developed algorithm for **package data imputation** that learned from **5% labelled packages the sizes of all packages with 10% error in volume estimation**. This was further used as input for all downstream analytics company-wide.
    

- Performing code reviews, directing and facilitating the problem-solving process, reading papers, and disseminating knowledge throughout the org. Hiring, interviewing, mentoring, and helping out team members. Grew team from none to 5 people. 
    

- Model Deployment via containerization and/or REST services (flask, plumbr, FastAPI).
    

- PostgreSQL, R, Python, Julia, Java.
    

Commeq Asset Management (Hedge Fund)

6.2016-09.2016

Quantitative Developer

- Developed an algorithmic trading system with Python. Refactored the codebase to use 6x fewer Lines of Code. Improved trading performance of back-test : 5-year sharpe ratio from 1.61 to 1.68 (SnP 500 for the period – 1.48) .
    
- Performed natural language processing work for news classification and tagging (multi-label classification problem), significantly improving on the currently used rule-based models. The measurement was Hamming-Loss.
    .

Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment (Sports Betting)

11.2013-04.2016

Quantitative Analyst / Developer

- Developed research and testing prototypes and production software for sports models. This software determines the probabilities and odds for all event in a sporting match (goals, points, and so on).  Their prices (odds) are the main product, offered by the company. 
    
- Revamped Volleyball, Badminton, Table Tennis models, boosting P&L on them significantly. Basketball model development as a secondary contributor. 
    
- &lt; 0.5 second response time of Sports models for calculation of all markets for all sports.
    
- Developed large parts of statistical customer classification models: dangerous or not, VIP or not, about to churn/not, customer lifetime value, duplicate accounts, scorecard models. Used Machine Learning, statistical, and Probabilistic programming techniques. Productization of said models. One of them had +4% impact on the vertical PnL.
    
- Ad-hoc analysis of various business aspects, coming up with new product ideas (e.g. pricing combos) and their mathematical aspects, A/B testing, stakeholder presentations.
