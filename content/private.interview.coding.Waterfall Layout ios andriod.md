Question Statement
Implement Waterfall Layout 

Description
The problem statement is to implement a waterfall (columned) layout. The candidate will be given an interface for a waterfall layout container view, then they will be asked to implement layoutSubviews() for the container view to implement the layout algorithm. Their layoutSubviews() implementation should lay out all subviews in stacked columns.

Implementing layout algorithms is everyday job for an iOS developer. This question gathers signal on how well-versed the candidate is in coming up with generic layout algorithms and their general problem-solving ability. Furthermore, it gathers iOS signal by seeing how well the candidate understands the UIKit view hierarchy tree, layout cycles/passes, and UIView frames and bounds (frame-based layout).
