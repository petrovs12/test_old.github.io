# Binary Tree Playground

## Binary Tree Interface
basic one'

## Making the Tree Copiable

### In order traversal
 

### all strings


Say, "add an -allStrings method that returns an array with the order determined by an in-order traversal". This part is pretty simple and usually takes no time at all (all candidates know to or ask if he/she can use the previous method implemented). This is just a quick check that the candidate is comfortable with the class written so far and can use blocks comfortably.

### Array by removing duplicates

- (BOOL)isBinarySearchTree;
- (BOOL)containsObject:(id)object; (assuming it is a binary search tree and that it doesn't have only strings; they need a comparator)
- (void)addObject:(id)object; (this requires the use of strings, numbers, or the class to be init'd with a comparator.)

just a bunch of crap
