Hold yourself accountable by making real punishments

## E- Environment

Set up your environment to make it easier to do the right thing and hard to do the wrong thing

## D- Distraction Cheat Sheet

Whenever you get distracted, write down what you were doing and what distracted you. Then, when you get back to work, you can see what you were doing and what distracted you. This will help you to see patterns and make changes.

## S- Schedule

## M- Minimum Viable Task

If I want to study for 2 hours, but this seems daunting, then force myself to study 1 hour, before that force myself to just set up the environment.

Move the bottleneck from motivation to environment. This requires setting up the enviromnnt, but the motivation for that can be lower cause it's easier to automate and doesn't require cognitive power, and thus doesn't require much willpower.
