# Approach to Generate Insights

## Follow-Up Questions

1. **Communicating Validity Threats**  
    How do you articulate threats to the study's internal and external validity?

2. **Reporting Survey Results**  
    What considerations do you prioritize when presenting survey outcomes?

3. **Impact of Limitations on Interpretation**  
    In what ways do the study's limitations influence the interpretation and dissemination of results?

4. **Conveying Uncertainty**  
    How do you express the uncertainty inherent in estimates and comparisons?

## Focus Area Guidance

### Data Preparation and Cleaning

### Generation of Relevant Insights

- **Insufficient**  
  Misinterprets technical analysis and results; unable to derive understandable insights for the intended audience.

- **Solid**  
  Converts analysis outcomes into key insights tailored for the audience.

- **Exceptional**  
  Utilizes a nuanced process to extract insights, integrating multiple data points or perspectives to inform and drive actionable results.

### Tailoring Communications to the Audience

- **Insufficient**  
  Fails to adapt information to the appropriate audience, regardless of the accuracy and relevance of the content.

- **Solid**  
  Effectively communicates research findings in a manner suited to the audience's level of understanding, accommodating both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

- **Exceptional**  
  Masterfully customizes technical information regarding analysis results to meet the specific needs of the audience, adjusting communication styles as necessary.
