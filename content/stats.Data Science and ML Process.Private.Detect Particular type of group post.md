So the questions how to build a classification model in order to to detect a particular type of heart or to detect whether a post particular pose by particular route in the particular group in particular context is a certain type of post in this case or not for selling something so does the task I want expected to do is to figure out like what dental solution would look like which means we need to go over like some what is being shown to customers when how quickly what is the scale of the problem do need to apply to all the posts what is the what is the business success criteria for this that's appropriate as well as like counter measures that should not regress when we launch then of course so basically how things should look like then how is it friend as a learning problem which is of course a classification problem in this case then like feature engineering teacher, dealing with coldstart problem dealing with how to serve it possibly and how we deal with like yeah I mean again off-line versus online objective functions and also dealing with the coastal problems so if there is a new user new group or new new new new, I like it there is something new how do we feel this parameter sent yeah OK what is also the cost of false positives versus false negatives which is I suppose for example the benefit of this future and the business goal is to surface some economic value is derived we need to talk about how we derive labels for these things if something is a sales or not perhaps it makes sense that sales other like something that gets certain signals after for example, there could be an added to the post that something to the effect of this is this assault it could be that I expect certain engagement to happen certain like type of unusual engagement to happen such as like volume of chat messages from non-fri or like contact which haven't been contact for which haven't been acting for a while to to spike for a short time like such such things basically the false negative Ao



Is TC capable of defining this as a machine learning task and specifying the loss function?
Explore multi-modality, incorporating both text and images, and delve into one or both based on TC's expertise. For example:
- Methods for extracting text features.
- Comparing embeddings with n-grams.
- Sequence modeling for text and its advantages over n-gram approaches, including state-of-the-art techniques like BERT.
- Image classification techniques.
Address data imbalance by describing strategies to handle label imbalance and identifying which metrics are affected.
Discuss model architectures in detail, such as Wide and Deep models for handling sparse and dense features, and evaluate how feature interactions impact model quality.
Consider composite models that integrate various sub-models, and assess the effectiveness and potential technical debt from tight coupling.
If TC is interested in infrastructure, explore topics like model serving, feature extraction frameworks, and feature stores for embeddings.
