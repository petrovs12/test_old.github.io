Self-supervised learning is the class of machine learning unlocked with masked autoencoding. No labeling required! This avoids a huge bottleneck in developing machine learning systems. With masked auto encoding, all you need is a large data source, to hide some of it (or most of it in some cases) and train the system to guess the missing bits. The more parameters, the more sophisticated the internal understanding of the data domain. These approaches have been shown to beat the performance of traditional supervised learning on the same tasks.
