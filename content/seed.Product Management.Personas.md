Customers are actual people who (could) use your product. 

Personas are customer types. Must represent real target market!! 

**Don't make personas for non-target markets! **

Keep details sparse and focused on what is relevant to the product/use cases.

Also, 'jobs to be done' based customer segmentation (Clayton Christensen). Great way to build good personas.

When writing, write only stuff that's relevant to your product! Delete rest

- Priorities, related to your product/area of expertise
- Pain points
- Imagine customer journey, how do you beat the status quo? I.e., how do you do better than the curren tprocess

## Profiles

- Name 
- Picture 
- Details
- Goals 

format. Can do it in google docs/word, or use some specialized persona management tool

# Demographics

Overused, use demographic information only if relevant, else use goals/targets/objectives/constraints/feelings/etc.

Focusing on common pain points/objectives/desires segment better than demographics!

Try to make it a real persona.

# More Goals, Needs and Constraints than Demographics

One way to look at it is 'what is this person trying to optimize for? What are their constraints '

# Example Personas

## **'EVERYONE' is not a persona**

Way too broad, too vague, not actionable.

## The 'mom' persona.

## 2/3-sided marketplaces (AirBnb).

### AirBnB example

- Renter 
  'Feel like a local' culture. 
  'Cost'.
  'Doesn't care about service.'


- Host 

  Figure out motivation for renting the place. 

1. Sharing couch/room.

   Maximize revenue.

2. Retired couple, renting out vacation home.

Prefer longer stays and people who would treat place as their own.

- Persona Business Traveller (**non-target**)

  1. There to work, not 'feel like a local'.
  2. Favor service and convenience over saving costs, connecting with host, etc.
  3. Costs are discounted by various discounts, aimed at corporate customers.

  So the business travelers will not be the best customers for AirBnb.

### DoorDash - 3 sided marketplace

See [[engineering.system_design,,Ml System Design.Doordash Talk#^usergoals]]

## B2B

The buyer and customer are different personas. E.g.

- CEO vs HR/Ops persona.
- Parent vs Child Persona

## Mom

Can my mom use it? Middle aged person, who's not a technology early adopter.

## Accounting/Business

### Multinational Tom

 Simple accounting/office/shift management software might not have all features 
 Tom needs, e.g. management of different offices, tax systems, etc.

 Can tolerate bad UI, as staff's job is more specialized and they can learn it.

### Gill Small Business Owner

Doesnt' need all features Tom might need **AND** doesn't want to be especially trained to use a software that supports them all.

Can't tolerate bad UI as she needs to run the whole business..

## Very Busy Persona

If the persona you're targeting is very busy, beside solving the pain point, usage  should require **no training**.

# Use Cases

How would a a given persona use the product to solve a specific problem?    

## Multiple Personas
