My 2024 job search numbers.

Compared to 2022, my resume-to-HR-screen conversion rate dropped significantly in 2024. Even referrals—often a game-changer—were hit or miss, only worked in 50% of my applications . While the numbers weren’t catastrophic, I felt that everything was dead. 

Hiring managers in various chats told this: some roles now receive 300–500 applications in a week, with standout candidates emerging from the first 100 resumes. The competition is enourmous.

My approach?

𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗲𝘀: I skipped tailoring to position (I'm lazy) but created two versions: data product and general product. This time, a career coach helped refine my CV, while ChatGPT polished grammar and added a touch of flair. Customizing for specific roles by ChatGPT felt too generic and didn’t reflect me.
𝗖𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗟𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀: Only for dream companies, often drafted with ChatGPT.
𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀? A better final conversion in 2024, with all offers coming through referrals. Regular applications led to zero offers.
