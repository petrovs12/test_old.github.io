[Art of Grieving Well](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PHnMDhfiadQt6Gj23/the-art-of-grieving-well)
It's one perspective, a bit underestimating the initial parts and not discussing utility of 
avoidance, adressed in the comments. But it's very good overall.

Key part is it's framing loss in several ways that all seem kind of true and helpful.

Eg. :
world has changed, you have to move to a new world without the valued thing, but 
the process of noticing and recognizing it feels like it's doing the 'moving itself'.

Practical advices...

Don't ask for more effort. Grieving persons see things clearly. Don't burden them with your incompetence of dealing with the situation.
