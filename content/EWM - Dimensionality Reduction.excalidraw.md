## 
Dimensionality Reducton
Dataset Gathering
1. Single Batch dataset
Being created already- 1 working day

2. Multiple Batch Dataset
More stable/more data?
Solves the 'long experiment' problem

3 work days?



### Assignment Backend 
to Support Dimensionality 
Reduction 
20 work days?
Risky, Sergei to advice

Backend Investigation
(partially covered by items in
the roadmap, moving 'traffic utilization metrics'


Remove Priority System


#### Bin Packing Algorithm  
6 working days 

(With priority as now)
Without priority system-
maybe can pack more.
 
if clusters, then can plan multiple 
weeks ahead (15 working days total)


##### Final Dimensionality Reduction
+ 'experiment setup to 
vector' function


###### Dimensionality Reduction Function


1. sklearn NMF
()

if doesnt wosk
2. Try to roll out randomized NMF.
(2-3 weeks)
3. Create predictive model:
 projection' from opt goal, 
buying type, (optional)

1 week? 

Very small adset provisions
not 1-10 but more like 
but 100s to 3-4000

Probably 1 week


###### Cluster guardrail checks
See if we can replicate
the cluster guardrail 
checks in the 'new' dimensionality 
reduced space.

tbd Probably 10 working days?


####### Clustering Provisions
(risk)
Stable-ish clusters?
Clusters as 


##### With Priority System as Now-
No backend changes;
Dimensionality reduction part only
logged on the backend

If no changes to priority,
can release, allocate experiments
similiarly



###### Release


###### Build out 'what if' scenarios, overall 
scheduling flow, etc.
??
20 working days?

Testing Period
