OK, so the way incremental and conversion lift works is as follows first let's say we're like advertising platform and we want to check what is the incremental value that we providing to our advertiser compared to anything else that might be happening for example how they could like someone can be buying stuff because they have already made up their mind or they have prior knowledge etc., etc. or like whatever other reason and they might also be on on our platform in this case, for example they might have already decided to buy some shoes and the five that we showed them are on advertisement for these shoes actually didn't do anything so how do we test for this incrementally team? There is a hold out group which would not get advertisements from certain campaign groups or certain facts likeaccounts, etc. in this group would be a certain size then for these ones we just blow this block showing those outs altogether however we do still track conversions the conversion event since yeah basically whatever event so we care about in general with them or whatever events were comp we are interested in rather so for those hold out users and for those accounts, we still we still have in our purchase events and this is the baseline and then we basically compare the odd score realize by the group so don't know hold our group and the outscore realized in quotations for the for the no hold out group for the whole group scared by the groupand this is what determines our incremental value to the customers


So now, how cute how scary lift works in our platform is a different man I want to get into, but it's also way internally for us to determine how the value for the users would change how the value for the advertisement from their viewpoint would change if we do some changes on the delivery system.
