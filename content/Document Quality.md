#fit_to_audience

I am fully committed to making documents easy to understand. However, 
while following the feedback

 I sometimes hit a an impasse after significant effort put into follwoing your wishes and pointers, to where I feel it's not on me anymore, and just more time may be needed.(to put in bluntly- jerked around). Other doc qualities will suffer if i keep going.

 thus, I want to clarify I'll keep taking feedback and improving, 
 but conditional on other doc needs as well. 

## Action Items

How adjustable are the estimates? I did try to reduce ambiguity to the extend possible, which prompted me to not total up the estimates in the beginning.

suggestions how to handle this:

1. allocate specific time and a separate doc (?)

# Writing for the Audience

I am also part of the audience. Need to have links to refer to and do reviews on part of design.

## 4 Anecdotes:

- People want to see different things in the same document.
- Felt a ton of resistence on 'ideological' grounds.
- vague ph
- Tables and de-syncing of information
- Organizing via outline and collapsing.

### Formatting, Aesthetics

Fixed whitespace, font, etc.

### Outlines, Collapsing, etc.

You said, "I wish there was a way to collapse all headings." Consider using collapsible sections to improve readability and navigation within the document.

You said, "I will. There was a way that we can collapse by default, all the settings under all the headings under some level." And I did that.
I left the collapsed items in a state I thought specifically you might want to read them/not read them. I improved the whole structure so the outline reflects the content.
So, I did put significant effort to take the prompt and make it easier for you specifically  (or anyone) to skim and orient yourself.
If in spite of this you claim you can't orient yourself, I don't have any concrete actions to do. I would not remove the techinical parts, as they are crucial for estimation.

But other people (and me) are also audience. I need an easy way to point other engineers to parts i want them to read and review.

You also noted how confusing duplicated information is, when YOU cared about it.

### Table of Milestones

1. I wrote a milestone list, with outline and headings, from the get-go.

2. Then first paul requested GSD, copied over info,  you requested table despite gsd being there, made table.
   now same info is triplicated, some items are under review/further spec, and _every time stuff needs to by synced_ .
   gsd doesn't support 'working days' concept. Sergei didnt like gsd, as I put several overlapping tasks, manually synced with milestones list. I get yelled at that basically i put rough dates in gsd, synced with the dependency graph and am accused of being 'unfocused'.

3. i understand the requirements- make the milestone list so its easy to understand delivery dates, but we're still under review. is it okay to change them, or?

4. then you yell at me for 'understandign nothing about project status' and put it in your official statement, and I spend a day trying to sync the stuff, going as far as computing workdays and holidays.
