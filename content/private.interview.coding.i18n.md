Description
Given a pattern (such as "i18n"), check if the input string ("internationalization") matches it.



Ask it as the main question: 15-20 minutes

Question Statement
i18n is a short way to write down internationalization

When given a pattern and an input string, check if the input string matches the pattern.



Example
i18n should match internationalization, but not interpolation

f6k should match facebook, but not focus

Similarly F2eb2k or 8 should match Facebook
