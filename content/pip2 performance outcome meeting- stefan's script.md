1. Opening Remarks

• Express Gratitude

• “First of all, thank you for the learning opportunity.”

• “I appreciate the time and effort you’re investing in me during this process.”

• Acknowledge the Importance of Growth

• “It’s important to grow and work on areas that can be improved.”

• “I value this process as a means to enhance my contributions.”  
              ‘Thank you for your support

• Mention Mental Strain and Desire for Normalcy

• “While this process is mentally draining, I’m eager to continue working effectively.”

• “I look forward to resuming our normal workflow.”

2. Addressing the Formal Warning

• Express Concern Respectfully

• “I want to address the formal warning stating I failed to fulfill my contractual duties.”

• “I believe this is not accurate and would like to clarify any misunderstandings.”

• State Objection

• “I respectfully object to that characterization of my work.”

  

I am doing my work and delivering high quality things, in particular throughput improvements, which is in the main product of the team- more throughput directly corresponds to customers being able to do their job:  
1. Small experiments.  
2. Delivered 75% of launchable supply (last year)  
5.Drove an investment napkin manager said multiple times is ‘very valuable’. .  
  
4. Doing a project today that would free up 6% of usable supply  
4. Raised and tried to push the issue that we are losing 20-30% of our traffic for at least this year, trying to drive this issue.

         6. Proposed to resolve a big traffic conflict in our team in a scientific way between scaled lift and clusters.  
  

3. Responding to Alleged Areas for Improvement  
  
* continue focusing on doc quality, i am working with my mentor and requesting feedback from team members in a non-intrusive way  
* in retrospect, maybe time was not enough, as areas touched were many and estimating timelines required both design and consultation with stakeholders.  
As ‘very short’ doc requires a longer and more detailed doc before, maybe time was not enough. If i am to re-write it, can leave milestones elsewhere and make it short. But there was no time.

- pay much more attention to doc aestetics
    

- Continue improving storytelling- I am happy about the storytelling of the vision doc, need to strike the right balance ‘S and ‘A’ in the ‘star’ storytelling methodology.
