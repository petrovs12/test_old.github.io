During a meeting with Borislav, I discussed a potential position in the DAISY department, which focuses on Data, AI, and full-stack engineering within the capabilities sub-organization—a supporting unit. Projects and customer engagements in this department typically last between 8 to 18 months. The tech lead position offered was just under €4,000 per month. I attempted to negotiate for a director-level role.

I inquired about performance issues related to remote work, but Borisov indicated there were none; however, attendance at the Sofia office is required at least four days a week. I explained my current work and the types of projects I handle, mentioning concepts like the “direction axis” and “people axis.” I asked if the company needed specialists or generalists to fill any current gaps, but Borisov responded negatively. I felt I could have phrased this question more clearly. Overall, I am hopeful about being considered for a director position.
