*  Added 'fast estimates' of whether experiments will be scheduled
* Added 'overlapping experiments' to see what experiments overlap in traffic
* Added limited version of 'how to change experiment settings to be scheduled'  'How many segments will fit in a batch'
*  improved ability of small experiment owners to identify conflicting experiments, view traffic estimates quickly, and get recommendations how to change setup in order to get scheduled.  

* increasing [small experiment throughput](https://fburl.com/daiquery/4n90bmhi) by 140% Q4_2023-13.15/batch, Q12024-13.2 Q2-31.7 (without changing constraints).
