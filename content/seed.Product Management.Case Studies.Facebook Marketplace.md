## Seller-oriented metrics

Post an item for sale...

Do we know if transaction happens?
Message history, in-person interaction, de-listed.

Total number of sales.
Proxy metric for transaction- listings w/ a bunch of back and forth messages.

De-listed item/mark as sold, ask them.

Even distribution of demography using it (i.e. not so many professional shops use it).

Time spent per user (but conflict with task success).
