Ways to read a paper first pass

Video by sung- build skeleton first;
etc.
So go quickly trough the table of contents and try to gleam what the topic is and what are it's subtopics.

Useful for math ? Maybe not

**Main headings, start, end of paragraph, figures.**

How many concepts, what are the concepts, how dense.


Read ToC first.


**Try to ask deep questions as you go, even if you don't know the wods. Try to guess possible answers/ideas.**


Focus on the conceptual understanding, ignoring the stuff that makes no sense.

Go back and forth between pages.

As long as you feel like you're learning, should feel pretty happy with that by itself.


Go trough the pages briefly to finish the priming...

Doesn't really work with math (?)
