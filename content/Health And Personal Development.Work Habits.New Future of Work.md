**Main outtakes:**

**1. Levels of usage of remote work
**  
1.1. No action
1.2 Recreate office- synchronous communcation, interruptions, etc.
1.3 Adapting to the medium
4\. Asynch communication, seamless collaboration, public knowledge
5\. Nirvana (?) 

- Replicate office in online settings
- New processes

2. Live 'meeting notes' document, where everyone can comment etc.
3. Make _knowledge public_, then best ideas float up
4. _Hack against 'lizard brain'_ and dick-waving 
   Prevent

# Effective Remote meetings

"around 50% of meeting time is used effectively".

What is 'effective meeting'

<https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-surprising-science-behind-successful-remote-meetings/>

1. Stewardship mindset
   Protector and server of other's time
2. Set up for success

   ** Lean towards shorter meetings**

   **Sharpen the agenda**
   Make the agenda a set of answers to be answered, rather than set of topics to be discussed.

   **Use Video** 

   !![[Psychology.Social Loafing]]

   Video + inviting as few people as possible reduces that.

- Start and End on Time (pay attention to smooth technical setup)

- Norms 
  With your attendees, periodically create **mutual expectations** about what makes for a good remote meeting. Surface expectations, like **“let’s keep all contributions to no more than 60 seconds so everyone has a chance to speak,”** and **give colleagues a chance to reply**. To combat meeting fatigue in longer meetings, it’s helpful to **set norms about when folks can take breaks**, stand up, and stretch.

- Actively Facilitate
  "** Ivana, please share your thoughts**"

- Use Tools
  Don't use side conversation, use available in-chat technology. Speak up if missed something.
  Polls (Klaxoon, Pool Everywhere)
  Determine if consensous has been reached.

# End Meetings, Gathering Feedback

- **End Meetings Well** Clarify takeaways.
  Identify **who does what next**. 
  **Don't let anyone leave your meeting wondering what was accomplished or what the next steps are.**

- Ask for feedback
  Quick surveys- what's going well/not so well, provide ideas for improvement.
