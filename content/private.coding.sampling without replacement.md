given list L and int k, select k elements from L without replacement uniformly at random.

sources of randomness- rand()- returns a random number between 0 and 1
and randint(hi, lo) - returns a random integer number between hi and lo.




possible solutions - resamp 
 We can sample numbers some pointers in the range and then if it doesn't work out, we can select expected I guess would be on the order of K squared
