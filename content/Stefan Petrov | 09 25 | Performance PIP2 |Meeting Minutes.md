BODY OF THE MEETING

MGR: As you are aware you were on a performance improvement plan from 12 August - 6th September in regards to supporting you to meet the expectations of an IC5 Software engineer. 

In reference to a formal warning issued to you on 20th of June there were a number of gaps in your overall performance that needed to be addressed. In particular I have summarized it as:

1. Documents delivered independently and with low iteration time.
    
2. Clear and high-quality documents that are easy to read and include good summaries.
    
3. Timelines for milestones and a single place to track project progress.
    

As you know, the key areas of focus during your PIP were outlined in the [PIP document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E9P4ouXZGhGuaRn2HIRTiQFT8suHrak2Lg-mMgXrYIY/edit)

There were a number of areas where you did make some improvements: 

Direction:

- You wrote a strategy doc that created a good high-level overview and vision for the scheduler space. You referenced customer pain points and outlined unknowns.
    
- You generated milestones for his project independently and centralized them in a GSD project.
    
- In general your communication has improved, as can be seen in the summary sections for the docs you wrote.
    

Project Impact:

- Your project plan has a concrete impact which is aligned with the overall TL of the area.
    
- You delivered your work within business hours.
    

Do you have any feedback on these? 

EE:  No, Thank you 

  

However there were still a number of gaps in line with the IC5 expectations that you still failed to consistently demonstrate based on my observations and on team feedback:

Scope:

- You are not demonstrating sustained productivity, delivering noticeably fewer diffs than other team members. In addition, despite setting a target for meaningful and constructive diff reviews you did not meet it, reviewing many diffs but having meaningful engagement in only a small number. Feedback from Sergei and others in the team supports this. 
    
- While on-call time was accounted for in the PIP, even by applying a 25% discount to productivity metrics (to represent 1 week of on-call out of four weeks on the PIP) the outcome does not change and diff count is still significantly below the discounted team average of ~11.
    
- The iteration time on your documents continues to be high, detracting from your productivity and impacting the time of multiple other team members. Your project doc required iteration across the entire length of this PIP and is still of lower quality than the documents produced during the previous PIP.
    

EE: I would like to finish. I have concrete feedback on these. Let's do them at the end.  

Direction:

- You were unable to proactively and independently produce high-quality documents. For example, you alternated between high-level and extremely detailed designs, making the document hard to understand. As with the last PIP, you are good at responding to feedback and making changes to your docs at multiple points after receiving that, but were not able to do this proactively, despite having good examples from your previous PIP as well as from others in the team.  
      
    This was demonstrated by two things: the length of time it took to complete documents, and the amount of external input you required in order for his document quality to improve. You required a high amount of engagement from me, from Sergei L, and from others in the team. Sergei reported that he had multiple meetings and ad-hoc engagements with you every week, in excess of the 1-hour-per-week target, and that iteration time on your project doc was considerable. This is accounting for the period of time when Sergei was ill.(1 week)
    

  
  
  

Project Impact:

- You had to be pushed to have concrete impact associated with his projects, with no goals firmed up until the fourth week of the PIP. This was in spite of the metric and targets already existing, as they were created by the overall TL for the area, and feedback provided that vague statements such as “we have a goal to do this” were not sufficient. What I would have expected to see is you using other project documents as a template, where goals and impact tend to be clearly called out.
    

Engineering excellence: 

- As noted above, your productivity is low, both in terms of diffs landed and in terms of the speed with which you responded to feedback. The number of diffs landed during the PIP was substantially lower than the team average, and feedback from teammates was that your iteration time on your own diffs was quite slow, with diffs being left as “in review” for multiple days.
    

  

These are the main feedback points and I'd like to give you an opportunity to respond to each.

  

EE: You don't have a summary? 

MGR: That was the summary.

EE: Thank you for the learning opportunity and it's very stressful for everyone and I value your engagement and time as well as everyone involved. It's draining and I look forward to our normal workflow resuming. This meeting takes some time to prepare and there are multiple places and so many surfaces (different tools/systems) that it's difficult to prepare. Even if it's delivered, maybe it's not clear where the information is or is not checked or so.

I want to address the previous formal warning that I failed to fulfill my contractual duties and I reject that statement and my request is to have it removed and to not continue to do that. I am performing my duties in particular Improvements. 

Small experiments it was alleged that output of PIP1 is broken.

I would like to show that PIP1 is not broken - experiments are now 60-70 per week.(stefan sharing his screen) 

Last year I delivered an increase to cluster and I drove investment marketing but Forrest said it's not very valuable.  The project today has time for impact freeing up 60% of supply and I have tried to show we are losing 20% traffic for the year which I tried to drive awareness to the issue.

I am trying to do my best to scope out the area and resolve traffic conflicts between problems we have. 

  

On the feedback thank you for the summary. 

Let me go point by point;

Productivity on the diff comments: I tried my best to look for Diffs to review and tried to review and leave constructive comments. I put some there that I think you decided to not count. 

Regarding the overall feedback I also cannot…..  I am doing my best there and I have concrete plans. We have projects and multiple projects and amendments which are trying to improve technical excellence. 

I try to allocate 30 mins a day to do that. I also discuss with my mentor what I can do there. 

Regarding diffs landed I think stats are wrong and not depend on me as you are claiming

Set up: plan for the area at the end of June which changed drastically whilst I was on PTO and sick leave and the PIP was written prior to that. There was another project that needed support and this took more time than I thought it would.

During implementation I have concerns for the area that I also have to address.

Plans changed and there was resistance in regards to direction of work which drained productivity. 

What was requested in the PIP the time was too short for it and I asked for an extension but this was ignored.

MGR: Can you clarify where you shared/asked for that? 

EE: I shared it in chat before I went on sick leave I will try to find it, i'm pretty sure I did

I understand there are concerns and it takes time to land.

  

On- call: Ok I think it was a significant factor, writing with Victor and writing my own stuff and writing documents that were sufficient for Sergi. Diff completed during the PIP yes it was low and if you make the discount you can make 3 and a half.

If you look at the medium I am aligned with the team.  I was missing(on LOA) for 6 weeks so I think it's ok.

  

Regarding productivity and independence: The gaps Sergi called out were not critical to the project and were aligned with Paul, Victor and Sergi. There were many gaps that Sergi mentioned and I took notes on which were supportive and which were not important. I took to heart all of them.

The lowest estimation I gave verbal and written explanation for them. 

The feedback was useful for me on the project but there is also some feedback that was not useful such as what the document should contain or discuss the big picture which was part of Sergi's preference. 

Long standing members (Peter) didn't appreciate how this works and newer members such as Recardo appreciated some context. 

  

Regarding alleged time drain for engineers I don't think that is relevant, some items point to Sergi trying to pulse his view on how things should be done. In some parts it's like your interpretation of who requested the review and I dont think it's a drain on productivity. I don't agree with this part. I don't think the docs were lower quality in any way. After consulting with my mentor I will consult with making future iterations.

I requested feedback and tried to lean in and not waste people's time which was feedback the last time. 

The doc quality was that clear.  

  

Proactively and independently: this is not true, if a short design doc is required and is desirable the way to produce it is to make a long one to estimate how long it would take. It would have taken more time and I will try to do it. I have lots of writing and storytelling to do, maybe there wasn't enough time for it but I'll try to improve that part. If that makes sense. I left responses to the comments about these docs so I think I addressed these points. With the correct diff numbers and we can see im at the medium regarding diffs landed 

  

Regarding Diffs staying in Q and the time it took to review, this is in the middle. On time in review yes diffs were longer I haven't talked about that. For this point I think it was not easily avoidable that POC were not in timezone.

  

Reading difficulty:I understand I will try to improve aesthetics and storytelling and from the vision doc I could see that. I hear what you are saying. I think this was a phrasing issue, I did commit to it at the start of the PIP and we did agree verbally that this is a project we do and maybe my phrasing within the doc was not clear enough. 

For me If I write we have this goal it means I am taking this goal, I will try to be more clear. Maybe I was afraid that I was committed to it and there was no time to do an analysis.

Next time I'll ask if I can change it in a week and use clear language. It was not my intention to use vague language. Sorry for the confusion caused by this. I didn't have the intention to push for impact. I like having an impact.

  

Did I answer all questions about project status?

MGR: That was something you did a good Job on. 

EE: In the last document you said the project was not clear, if you still have this opinion?

MGR: What are you referring to?

EE: Screen shared “Post PIP”-  This section.

MGR: Is my comment in the document clear?

EE: No.

MGR: I was away last week so I included a “post PIP” section to capture the feedback, when looking at the project doc you would be keeping milestones in order. The first one was a 2 day milestone and it was expected. After I wrote this comment, we spoke and you clarified how you were planning your work. 

EE: yes I did update you when you came back and I have a post and project, doc shared with me. So sorry. 

  

Pause for questions:

NK: I just wanted to say from my view that today was more of a conversation than confrontational, more what I would expect in meta on collaboration and trust side. That there are differences to be discussed. 

MGR: I understand how stressful this has been. You have been approaching this in a calm way and bringing your questions in a more thoughtful way. A PIP process is not great and it's a tough and stressful process. I want to thank you for how you have shown up.

EE:Thank you its ok its normal, one big part is everyone is limit ability or close to so sometimes it's tricky to also get alignment with people view and things change so much 

- Bunch of things in there helpful
    
- Disagree on many parts
    
- Overall expectation were hard
    

  

CH: I'd like to take a moment to reiterate some of what was said here, this has not been an easy process for everyone involved. Stefan for you it has been a tough process, and for Forrest it has also been challenging. There have been marked improvements on the process since the first PIP. From learning to feedback and communication, we all know there have been many differences of opinions on things but thank you both for continuing to engage.

  

I am OOO next week so we will try our best to come back to you buy the end of the week

NK: I just wanted to understand the formal process, has it finished? You will follow up as you deem fit but for the day to day? 

CH: yes business as usual Stefan is still expected to meet the expectations of role and level and we will come back to him with an outcome once Forrest has had time to review all the documents provided.  

  

MGR: scheduling, I may be sick next as my wife has covid. 

  

  

CLOSING THE MEETING

MGR: Thank you for providing your input today.

I will now take away all the information provided today and I will need to take time to consider if further action is required or not. 

MEETING ENDED
