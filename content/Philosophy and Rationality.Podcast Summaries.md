### Neuralink

* Solve Paralysis
* More bandwidth when communicating (telepathy)
* Direct Communication Interface (e.g. run Spotify song on audio processing part of the brain)
* Procrastination and Having a System, .g. work for a 3 hour blocks in the morning
* Anxiety and "clean fun", rather than guilty fun. ![](https://store.waitbutwhy.com/collections/posters/products/dark-playground-poster-18x24)
* [Procrastination Blog Post](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html).
* How our brain processes film and music
 Language is low-bandwidth. For example,I say 'this film made me sad and  angry'. You're not going to necessarily understand what 'angry' means in this context. In reality, a film or book evokes a multitude of thoughts, which are complicated and hard to convey in low-bandwidth media, such as language. If I have a Neuralink connection with you, I can directly give you the bucket of thoughts and feelings that I'm feeling.
 __Stefan's commentary__ - it's debatable if this makes sense, as you still have the summarization problem. 
 That is, why would the bucket then be more concise of just the person watching the movie?


 * Elon Musk and thinking from [[Philosophy and Rationality.First Principles Thinking]]
 Have to find a balance between thinking from first principles and [[Philosophy and Rationality.Reasoning by Analogy]], as the latter is faster.

* Echo Chambers and Idea Labs
[[Philosophy and Rationality.Echo Chambers]]
An Echo Chamber has a religious component. 'My peer group has decided to take this position on the topic so this is my position as well'.

An Idea Lab follows the [[Philosophy and Rationality.Scientific Method]] to evaluate ideas by designing and running experiments and analyzing their results.
