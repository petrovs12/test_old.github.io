# vertical order traversal 
Available on Leetcode at https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-vertical-order-traversal/

Given the root of a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from top to bottom, column by column).
If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be from left to right.


# BFS with sorting

Interesting. I think most of my candidates still struggle with it. When they are able to code it, they usually run out of time to test it...
If we want to replace it, how about printing the the tree layer by layer, as if you were peeling an onion?

however, its very often asked...
