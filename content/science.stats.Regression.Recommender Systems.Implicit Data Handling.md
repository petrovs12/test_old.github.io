Flexible:

- Frame it as classification problem, use built-in loss function.
- Frame it as a ranking problem, use custom loss functions (typically using also [[science.math.Optimization.Optimizers In in Neural Networks.Negative Sampling]]) .
  See also ![[science.stats.Regression.Loss Functions#^ranking-metrics:#^ranking-end]]
- Frame it as a weighted regression/classification problem.
