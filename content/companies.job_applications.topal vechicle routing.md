• Design and implement optimization algorithms, focusing on vehicle routing and shipment allocation.

• Enhance the performance of existing optimization solutions, ensuring scalability and robustness.

• Collaborate with the data science team to integrate OR models into the broader logistics platform.

• Deploy optimization solutions in production environments and ensure reliable performance.



[Required Skills]

• Strong expertise in Operations Research, including experience with linear programming, constraint programming, or dynamic programming.

• Proven ability to implement OR models in production environments, ideally in logistics or similar domains.

• Solid programming skills in Python or a similar language.

• Familiarity with solving large-scale optimization problems, including vehicle routing or shipment allocation.

• Experience working with optimization tools such as Gurobi, CPLEX, or equivalent.



Nice-to-have:

• Experience with data science tasks, such as regression or time series analysis.

• Familiarity with cloud-based environments for optimization model deployment.

• Background in applied mathematics or a similar quantitative field.



[Engagement Highlights]

• Flexible workload - full-time preferred, but open to part-time

• Opportunity to collaborate with an experienced data science team.

• Preferred time zone overlap: 10 AM to 4 PM EST, but open to less

• Start date: Immediate.
