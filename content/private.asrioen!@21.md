    <td class="info">Cannon is a realtime massive fanout system capable of delivering messages to hundreds of millions of subscribers of a topic in seconds for persistent offline subscriptions. For those who are familiar with Skywalker, which also delivers messages to topic subscribers, the biggest difference between Skywalker and Cannon is that the former deals with online subscriptions - user devices have to be connected to one of the many gateways (e.g., MQTT, Chatproxy) in order to receive messages. Also such subscriptions are ephemeral meaning the users are automatically unsubscribed once they are out of the current viewing context or simply turn off the device. Cannon instead works with offline / persistent subscriptions that are stored in a database. This is ideal for use cases that do not require users to be online, e.g., sending push notifications, broadcasting messages on Messenger, etc.</td>
