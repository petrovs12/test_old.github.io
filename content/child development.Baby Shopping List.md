Watch some baby first aid videos/take a course. Get first aid and [grooming kit for newborn](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Thermometer-Aspirator-Scissors-Equipment-Newborns/dp/B07W7YWC67/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=baby+pflegeset&qid=1643489359&sprefix=baby+grooming%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-6). Also get some special [ baby laundry detergent](https://www.thebump.com/a/best-baby-detergent) and wash new everything new before wearing. Idk if needed, but my partner did it.

0. Baby stroller- not much opinion, you can buy used, just test it, look so it has big wheels as it's easier to handle. Also if you're driving, be careful if buying so it's easy to put a base on the car. I think there are different standards and so on. For us we put it without the base.


1. Bed - We used [Snoo Smart Sleeper](https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/snoo-smart-bassinet) . By far the best item on the list if you can get it, highly recommended. Will send some sleeping data separately.
[You can also look at this article](https://www.littlebabygear.com/cheaper-snoo-alternative/).
Also consider buying some [baby swaddles](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08DG66XWC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1). We bought some, but practically used only the ones w/ the snoo. 

2. Books - we read very little, but I do recommend [Emily Oster's books](https://www.amazon.co.jp/s?k=emily+oster&crid=6IVPRSTBTOZC&sprefix=emily+oster%2Caps%2C259&ref=nb_sb_noss_1).
We are using a lot of the advice there. It appeals to me cause it's short and it has a lot of meta-analyses of papers and help you ease your anxiety specifically about breastfeeding and so. She now has a [blog, which is pretty nice too](https://emilyoster.substack.com/).
I went trough first 5 chapters of [Baby 411](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Ari-Brown/dp/1889392618/ref=sr_1_1?crid=7LR0P02PBXVG&keywords=baby+411&qid=1643489049&sprefix=baby+411%2Caps%2C100&sr=8-1), it's great, then used rest for reference


3. [Dedicated white noise machine](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/SoundSpa-Shower-Sleeping-Adjustable-Stroller/dp/B07317NQKW/ref=sr_1_11?crid=E17IESH6MEN3&keywords=baby+white+noise+machine&qid=1643488800&sprefix=baby+white+noise+machin%2Caps%2C246&sr=8-11) is a great one.0ww


4. In-ear or contactless thermomether. Bonus: for boys for me it was super helpful to use the in-ear thermometer cap as a proxy for the bellow item the penis during diaper change.
5. For [boys](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/PT3080/dp/B004UGM6TS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1JJ88DXPJIJNV&keywords=teepee+peepee&qid=1643487378&sprefix=teepee+peepe%2Caps%2C231&sr=8-1) only. Helps with diaper change stress (you don't ha).
6. [Anti-smell diaper bin](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004ME5O6K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Helps a lot with the smell and have to change the inside bag only 1-2 times a week.

7. Diaper changing mat. Diapers, 99% water baby wipes, diaper changing non-reusable pads. Put those to subscription.
8. Pacifiers- buys several types to try
9. Breast pump- not sure, we used mostly a manual one, as it's easier to control power, but had a electrical one as well.
10. Baby bottle sanitizer (we had Phillips).
11. [Baby bottle warmer](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Multi-functional-Pacifier-Disinfecting-Instruction-Guaranteed/dp/B085QJCZ4M/ref=sr_1_39?keywords=%E8%B5%A4%E3%81%A1%E3%82%83%E3%82%93%E3%83%9C%E3%83%88%E3%83%AB%E6%AE%BA%E8%8F%8C%E5%99%A8&qid=1643487615&sprefix=baby+bottle+%2Caps%2C231&sr=8-39), just picked a random one. 
12. [Nasal Aspirator](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B09LLVMDCJ/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=%E8%B5%A4%E3%81%A1%E3%82%83%E3%82%93%E9%BC%BB%E5%90%B8%E5%BC%95%E5%99%A8&qid=1643487760&sprefix=baby+nasal+as%2Caps%2C229&sr=8-2)- I think this kind is quite good. You have some in the grooming kit as well, but for us we needed another kind...

14. Baby carrier and maybe [winter/rain protector for it](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07YBCKLB5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  We're not using the carrier too much, but that's cause I'm lazy and it was super cold. Probably go for ergobaby or so.

15. Maybe a [baby bathtub](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07JMWCXZB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1). We used it, but maybe you can just do it in the sink

16. If supplementing, consider looking for [low flow bottles](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B000OE2XFC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) so it's harder to reject breast.

17. Consider some contraption like [this](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00JZF8LHK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) in case baby is fussy on breast. We tried it but was a bit annoying to use. But if you're commited it probably helps...

18. [Baby doses of saline solution](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B007PZJOQ4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Honestly haven't used, but meh.

19. Liquid Vitamin D and some [topical baby oil](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B000ORYEF6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

20. Consider putting [some matress topper on your bed](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00J70WFFM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1), cause you know.

21. Buy some clothes as needed.


## From 6th week
21.Maybe some [black and white, 'chewable' books like so](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07SZK7HYC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Baby didn't care for them the first 6 weeks, after started to like them and play w/ them a bit. 
22. Re:toys, i got recommended lovevery. Checki it out. Else I recommend to pay attention to buy some toys that both make noise and are thin enought for baby to grab. For couple of weeks he was grabbing stuff, but we didn't have anything both small enough to grab, not hard, and noise-making.

## From 10th week
23. [Some stuff to chew on if needed](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B001ABZGU2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)


## Consider nannies/ au pair/etc.
