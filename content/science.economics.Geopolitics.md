Current Demographic problems of China.

Movement of Age Pyramid.

History of industrialization, cost of living, number of children, and cultural transition.

USA transitioned to industrializaiton over 7 (?) generations. This made it easier to figure out how to raise children in industrializing age.

China started in 1970s. 

In the village, children are free labor.
In the city, headache.

20-30s mid-low added value work+ consumption
40-50s high added value work + investment
60s+ capital gains
After- retirement- no economic impact.

very bad now...

Cold war:

US protects international trade (sea), in exchange writes everyone's security policy. 

For US- security, for rest-economic deal.

Now- US navy unsuited to protect international trade, suited for wars and power projection.

Too many battleships, too few destroyer ships.

End of the undettered globalization.

China bad politics+ bad demographics.

China- high dependency of raw material inputs.

Russia- lots of oil, natural gas, fertilizers, paladium, lithium.
Green revolution also doesn't work without Russia.

Wind and solar- don't work so well, batteries are a problem.
Not enough lithium in the world, maybe better battery technology.

Germany- stupidly still not embracing nuclear power.
Raw materials and such

Germany in trouble, but connected.

Will Ukraine blow up pipes? Maybe:

1. Yes, if they dont' want Russia to get funded.
2. No, cause they're now a Candidate member of EU and EU is going to rebuild them, so they have interest EU doesn't suffer and can function => has energy.

Putin maybe had to just invade Donbas + Land Bridge and would've been fine ?

Biden -putin meeting before that - mainly about hacker attacks on colonial pipe.

If China/industrial base of world- mass retirement.

But china very innovative, might be quite advanced in technology. This might offset some of the problems.
They are **more innovative and entrepreneural than anyone but USA**.

Germany- energy problems, can't keep lights on, 3rd industrial base in the world.

American political system.

[[science.math.Game Theory.Voting#^firstpost]]

Factions within the 2 parties. 

Re-alignment process within the parties, what are the key questions that determine if Republican or Democrat.

Process takes time and is not painless.

Everyone wants their issue to be the one that determines if you're Republican or Democrat.

Union movement is now Republican...

Oil/natural gas maybe quite inelastic ([[science.economics.Price Elasticity]])- if supply drops by 5-8%, price double.

US needs to double industrial base.
Maybe high growth+high inflation in US.

China- leader on climate, new tech...

Maybe 1.5-2 deg, rather than 3-6 before hitting net 0.
[[science.economics.Climate Change and Global Warming]]

Chinese geography not great for wind/solar.
Germany good for wind. But doesn't seem to work. Only generates 9% of actual electricity, >2 trillion of investment.
US good for wind+solar.
UK good for wind+solar.
Spain good for solar
Greece good for solar+wind.

Nuclear. Germans not willing to embrace Nuclear as part of the long-term solution.

Phisical chemistry - batteries.

## What should we do?

Some suggestions about american foreign policy...
