deceptiveness and ai

training 'against' deception wont work
say it's against 'overtly deceptive' things, or even if some introspection techniques work,
the 'i'will deceive now' thought pattern.

So, not only deceptive output, but also precursors.

We show how generically useful thought patterns that are not deceptive by themselves 
when combined can produce deceptive output.

imagine if the thought matches a predicate, it's marked as deceptive
[[science.math.logic.predicates]].

say the ai is a bit anthropomorphic, and it can spawn threads of thought
we name appropriately ('planning thread', monitoring thread, threads for different subtasks),
and it also has ....


conclsion picture:

ai as a problem solver can develop a 'abstractize the problem in a way that deception is not in the model',
solve it, invert the solution in steps that don't refer to deception...



example - sends instructions to a human-controlled wet lab to execute, blah blah biological goal, delays in the lab if instructions too long, ai notices a pattern, tries several things, where it notices threads get terminated for no apparent reason (every time the 'deceive' predicate) is matched, eventually represents everything as some kind of search in a graph or a vehicle routing or a markov decision process that doesn't 
refer to the humans and thus doesn't involve deception, it's not terminated, the inverted sequence of steps doesn't refer to deception.

Bonus:

How it also can notice it's forbidden to think about the specific predicate and thart 'thinkingabout that...'

#todo complete the incomplete parts of the [Deep Deceptieveness](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XWwvwytieLtEWaFJX/deep-deceptiveness).
 
 check more carefully what happens when talking about the 'fgure out the deception pattern' moment...
