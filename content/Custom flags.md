Custom flags are arbitrary predicates that can be attached to ads, campaigns, and other entities in the system. They are used to control the allocation of ads to experiments, among other things. Custom flags can be used to implement various types of targeting, such as geo-targeting, device targeting, and user targeting.

Some of them would have delayed attributiont. 

The main part to know about custom flags is that? Yeah, they are basically. So if the custom clock is not present or specified at all, then it's everything. And then after that it's the Union. If you put multiple ones.  We have a special DSL about them.
