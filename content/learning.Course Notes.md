# Meta-plan

## Watch video and take notes

### Burn Bridges

No brides to burn here

### Schedule

do it now

### Environment

Vs code and dendron are open, ready to open up excalidraw

### Distraction Cheat Sheet

Have it

# Catalyst Session Notes

## Community Rules

[How to ask good questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

- Show your work
- minimally reproducible example (of what didn't work)
- Show what didn't work, journey trough 
- Many ways to be wrong.
- So narrow down the problem as much as you can so people can help you

Cause there are many ways for something not to work, try stuff out...

## This course is not a spectator sport

[Mathematics is not a Spectator sport](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/mathematics-is-not-a-spectator-sport)
You have to cosntantly practice it...

Have to practice.

## Skill Acquisition is more complicated than just theory, practice is important too

## Claiming they are ahead of research

#TODO Why research trickles down slowly into practice

Common sharlatan claim?

Specific claims about learning- learner focused, rather than policy-focused.

 Research is policy focused (focused on what teachers should do...)

 Very doubious claims on this...

### Research practice gap

[ACM article](https://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/july-august-2010/the-research-practice-gap1)
#TODO check if this is real or not...s

The picture has soem problems:

1. What if the problem can be identified from first principles and on small scale studies?

## Deviation from the couRse

They claim it's super optimized and gaps will appear and bottleneck you later.

### Selective learning

### Lack of practice (spectator sport)

### Rushing

## Encoding vs PKM

The course focuses on learning how to learn and encode/understand things better, rahter than  \\
#TODO think about the difference a bit, even though there are huge overlaps I would say...

s

## Funcamentals vs Growth Stages

First it'sthe high yield stage, where we reap rewards from the fundamentals...

### How do you know you've mastered a technique?

Be able to apply it and feel it's kind of working. E.g. not looking at notes way too much...

70-80% only checking notes sometimes.

A bit more consolidations/practice.

Almost second nature to it.

[[Health And Personal Development.Unconcious Competence]]

 I **Higher Ground Series** is about modifying fundamentals for special contexts, like professional or ADHD, etc.

## The learning is path, dependent...

![](/assets/images/2022-08-06-12-13-53.png)
so small perturbations/errors propagate...
**So they don't recommend deviating from the course at all, cause they think it's optimized and the path dependency is strong.**

## How to take notes, when to take the notes, etc...s

### Peer feedback on Discord is nice already

### Office hours- group call - doctor consultation. Basically 1-on-1 with the instructor.

### Spot the issues

Library of worked examples

### Live clinics

2 hour group call..

## With the fundamentals- experiment

If you feel confused whenapplying some of the techniques.

Misinterpreted Effort Hypothesis
[[Health And Personal Development.Progressive Overload]]
[[learning.Misinterpreted Effort Hypothesis]]

Failure is Success...

Try many things...

## Mind Maps and Spatial organization is more important

One needs Very big mind maps, so then you need infinite canvas.

More processing of the information is better/more important...s

Digital mind-mapping is not as good, as you're consitriced by the options of thr pgoram.
but much more legible, otherwise I'm consitricted in the retrieval by mydexterity.

Also much harder to edit/ correct later.

So excalidraw is nice...s

## What do you do when you have holidays so techniques don't get too rusty...

### Differentiate between actual cognitive Load and one sucking/catastrophising

How do you know if it's cognitive load or if it's just too much.
Expert recycle. Try to do some measurements, gather feedback, etc.

## Pure Math

there is a help article...
procedural plus declarative knowledge components...

# Rapid Fire Modules Summary

### Urgency Trapping and Eisenhower Matrix

Have to make time for the important, but not urgent stuff.

Human biological tendencies are to do the urgent stuff, as it's difficult to find joules...

Prioritize important stuff, instead of urgent.

### Theory VS Practice Times

It should be a ratio of 1:5 for simpler things, and 1:30-1:40 for more complex topics...

So it's very very important to practice skills.

**Doing too much theory without practice can lead to cognitive overload and be worse than just doing nothing**

Summary:

Problem: 

We have day to day urges and distractions (like hw) that don’t translate to long term successes like doing well on tests.

Cause: 

We don’t prioritize more “important” tasks like proper studying over urgent tasks like “hw” or maybe even personal urges like loneliness or addiction.

Solution: 

We must recognize the tasks on the Eisenhower Matrix and reorganize our time to include the theory:practice ratio. We must organize by importance instead of urgency.
