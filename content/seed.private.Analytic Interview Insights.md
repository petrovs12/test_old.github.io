(Optional) Please explain how you would go about selecting a model for the following situations.

Follow up prompts
How would you detect a satisfaction difference between different groups/segments?
How would you detect a satisfaction difference over time?
Please describe the following, including their assumptions, benefits, and limitations: Linear regression, Logistic regression, and Mixed-effects models
Focus Area Guidance
Conducts data preparation and cleaning procedures
Insufficient
Conducts an unstructured or unclear data preparation and cleaning process; does not properly clean or prepare data for analysis
Solid
Executes on a clear and structured process for preparing and cleaning data (e.g., gathers appropriate data; tests and validates data)
Exceptional
Effectively defines, structures, and executes on the data cleaning and preparation process; proactively transforms data in preparation for analyses
Selects appropriate data analysis approaches
Insufficient
Struggles to identify and implement appropriate analysis techniques and methods
Solid
Discusses appropriate analytical techniques and approaches to solving the research problem
Exceptional
Identifies and implements advanced analytical techniques and methods; explains the thought process and tradeoffs of different approaches in detail
Identifies appropriate variables
Insufficient
Does not provide detail regarding relevant variables that should be analyzed; misses opportunities to specify how variables will be evaluated
Solid
Discusses and identifies important variables to analyze; distinguishes how variables will be examined (e.g., observed or included in model); identifies major confounds
Exceptional
Displays strong understanding and prioritization of analyses of important factors; implements multiple comparisons and considers or controls for many relevant factors (e.g., confounding or third variables; covariates)
Demonstrates modeling and analysis knowledge
Insufficient
Does not demonstrate experience in or knowledge of relevant models or analyses; misses opportunities to translate knowledge into outcomes
Solid
Demonstrates working knowledge of model evaluation and analyses (e.g., effect sizes, significance levels, confidence intervals)
Exceptional
Displays advanced working knowledge of and experience in modeling and relevant modeling analyses; leverages knowledge to drive effective solutions
Generates relevant insights through a sense-making process
Insufficient
Confuses basic information about technical analyses and results; cannot identify comprehensible insights for the audience
Solid
Translates analysis into key insights for the audience
Exceptional
Leverages a process to determine nuanced insights; incorporates multiple points of data or views to make sense of results and drive action on the insights
Tailors communications to the audience
Insufficient
Does not tailor the information to the appropriate audience, even if information and knowledge may be correct
Solid
Clearly communicates related research findings that suits the audienceâ€™s level of understanding (e.g., technical and non-technical audiences)
Exceptional
Expertly tailors technical information regarding analysis results to the specific needs of the audience; adapts communication style to the needs of the audience
