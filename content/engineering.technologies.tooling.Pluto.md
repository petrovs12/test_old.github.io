pluto is this interactive notebook (makes a DAG of the cells and re-runs what's needed when you change one-like a spreadsheet- so you it figures out the cell order for you)
and it has notebook-specific package manager, so when you open one nb, it installs the packages for you
Interesting. I'll check it out!
it's very cute:D spreadysheets are 40 years ahead of everyone

Oh yeah. I have heard that spreadsheets are purely functional programs with full referential transparency ðŸ™‚
