\section{Concluding Remarks}\label{sec:conclusion}
	In this paper, we study the optimal design of \cmtfinal{staggered rollout experiments}. \cmtfinal{These experiments} are particularly useful for studying \cmtfinal{the impact of} treatments that have causal effects on both current and future outcomes. Our goal is to optimally make treatment decisions for every unit at every time period, in anticipation of most precisely estimating the average instantaneous and lagged effects. This optimization problem can reduce the sample size requirement and directly minimize the opportunity cost of the experiment in practice. We first study the non-adaptive experiments, where the sample size is fixed and treatment decisions are made pre-experiment. We provide a near-optimal solution to the optimization problem.  We further study adaptive experiments, where the experiments can be stopped early if needed. We propose the Precision-Guided Adaptive Experimentation (PGAE) algorithm for adaptive experiments. PGAE makes adaptive treatment decisions and allows for valid post-experiment inference. Finally, synthetic experiments on multiple data sets show that our proposed solutions for non-adaptive and adaptive experiments reduce the opportunity cost of the experiments by over 50\%, compared to non-adaptive design benchmarks.
