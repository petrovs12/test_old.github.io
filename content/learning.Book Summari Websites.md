- Nat Eliason <https://www.nateliason.com/> - good high-level thoughts

- Four Minute Books <https://fourminutebooks.com/>
  Many summaries, but short (&lt;=1200 words). Lots of ideas are out
  They donâ€™t actually read the books they write summaries for. They read the summaries on Blinkist and then write summaries of summaries.

- Blinkist <https://www.blinkist.com/> big and paid

- Shortform paid, but very high quality

- Growthabit <https://growthabit.com/>
  They have a detailed structure of every summary

- Derek Sivers <https://sive.rs/>

- The Ripening <http://www.theripening.com/>
