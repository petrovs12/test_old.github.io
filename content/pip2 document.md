Without changing constraints, a step change.

### Setup

What changed since last time:  

1. Less work outside of hours, dominated by pip-related stress.

2. Dramatic shift of focus to async communication.

3. Way larger scope, paying more attention to docs.

Pip doc written while I was on pto,forrest mentioned we can discuss directly when I’m back, but ignored all suggestions (oncall week 2), and others. Overall I didn’t belabor the point, as it was important to move quickly.

It was an interesting experience. The beginning was unexpectedly rocky, with unclear ownership, priorities and metrics and a lot of ambiguity. Pip plan was written before sick leave and PTO, and when it was presented many assumptions on the project had changed.

Specifically on the requested vision doc i encountered a lot of resistance from TL (and a bit less from forrest

Alignment with the main stakeholder for the area (TL Paul Ryland) was smooth, including goals and overall plan.

Resistance from Forrest+Sergei on ‘long vs short term’, big picture vs ‘make local change’ (despite having agreed and committed to the project I ended up with from day one). I think this resistance also has the effect of making reviews longer for the team, as the systems become more complex and so do design changes to them.

Struggle with Viktor was more on the axis of prioritizing ‘ops cost’  vs ‘ potential throughput’, and we didn’t fully agree, but still came up with a design that can support all points. Much of the feedback was unnecessarily picky and imo focusing on the wrong things.

This difference of opinions made me think quite hard how to explain things in , plus oncall being right in there made documents take longer than expected.  

Bias in ‘week 4’ feedback and overall behavior that was bad in a hurtful way:

1. Alleging I dragged down productivity by requesting reviews from a  joiner from 2 weeks ago, who thanked me for showing me the ropes, and a person Sergei leonenkov explicitly requested me to review with.
2. Alleging I only bring up that we lose 20-30% of traffic (i.e. our product) cause I am lazy about writing docs.

3. Stating that ‘understand work’ I propose to do is ‘not worth doing’ , when a few months ago we agreed to do it. Continual  
4. Allegeing I’m ‘too focused on bin packing’ and ‘investigation having concluded it’s not worth doing’, and thus not receptive to feedback about team priorities when none of the above is true.
5. Saying I provided ‘no updates’ <https://www.internalfb.com/gsd/1140518516447378/1112452106714038/details?reportID=452199784515861> - on 17, the pip doc was shared on 19th (Thursday, late again as always, by the way!)

Things that you thought I may take as nitpicky I did take to heart:  

1. Complaints about formatting, whitespaces, overall structure of docs, calling out risks.

2. Overall structure on the vision doc.

3. Proactivity in responding to questions.

Unhelpful drags on productivity (i.e. avoidable ‘ambiguity’).

1. The project plan was approved by paul, who owns this, on first iteration, but you’re claiming there were ‘unsustainable number of iterations’ to the point where the team suffers.
2. Having pip doc be non- editable, so I can’t attach e.g. pictures until the last moment, making it by default your narrative. Before copying this, I had to spend hours on taking external notes, copying your stuff, etc.
3. Generally strange statements, e.g. ‘no project progress report’ while I’m writing the design doc, everything is visible there.
4. Putting the ‘no work outside of business hours’ unhelpful.
5. Supporting battle of wills with sergei about removing one ‘big picture’ image from design doc [CSBABT Scheduling: Onboarding Regular and Clustered Types](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1QxJH0LswctBqtZQVpxTRioybju80iq1jC_DL6Bym1es/edit)
6. Asking to triplicate the same information within bounds of same design doc, with all 3 pieces having their purpose, then complaining about stuff being out of sync (without asking me).
7. Continuing misunderstanding (or pretending to) to do so on many different points, for example, during the discussion of the 20-30% traffic loss we have.
8. I think the team still struggles with impact estimates and prioritizing things someone isn’t escalating for. Maybe it has to do with DS not fully having ramped up and having been absent for personal reasons.

I wrote [\[RFC\] Budget A/B Test Scheduler Roadmap/Vision](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1virCPI2IOGacb1DMOHK6NaZbkPhESr8WmOnGlW62zRQ/edit), proposing a north star, providing motivation (from first principle observations of the current system, known metrics, and customer pain points), goals,  technical vision, and proposed projects, extending to [Q3 2025](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1virCPI2IOGacb1DMOHK6NaZbkPhESr8WmOnGlW62zRQ/edit#bookmark=id.q7ghl262ccee). Wrote high- level [plans for each projec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1virCPI2IOGacb1DMOHK6NaZbkPhESr8WmOnGlW62zRQ/edit#heading=h.77q09vt7vx6l)t there, ranging from sketch to detailed solution.  Includes also e.g. proposed objective functions to scheduler to reduce tension between projects, driven by customers being loud, and welfare for all customers.

I participated in the proactive scheduling working group- org wide.. Different scheduling initiatives across the org are not synced and have overlapping parts, common to all scheduling systems in the world, but in the same org we have 3 independently developed such systems- unifying the common parts is crucial.

Director also asked me to develop‘ traffic density metric’ for CS.

Similarly, I drove an investment napkin that [reached out across organizations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wTrF4LkDcFQtFUpBFNTxWlN7S7v6m0DMxQ5oOR_cYKM/edit#heading=h.edkvl4619gr9) my manager said would be ‘very valuable’ and encouraged me to work on.

 I have a co-authorship on [\[RFC\] Budget A/B Test Scheduler Redesign](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/12T_M-GRXyoD-cXvSHkqKqPyqs7njcmdgf_0UpvrBtyg/edit), and had+have to navigate significant difference in priorities with the co-author and main partner in the project (Viktor)- prioritizing possibility for throughput improvements vs ops cost, which seems to work, as the alignment happened, though it took larger chunk of the pip period that i hoped for.

In addition, decisions were made without me while I was away, which necessitated adjustments since pip was written.

Despite that, I did adjust quickly  to projects- agreed day 1 on the project to execute to be the one with known impact. I seem to be accused of not being flexible enough at places or focusing on ‘pie in the sky’ vision, but the ‘understand work’ I put in was also agreed by sergei previously, and the vision doc was explicitly requested.

Moreover, this is a critical area of the team, which has been ‘organically developed until now, and many aspects of it are hard to explain to even long standing team members, so vision is needed imo.

[CSBABT Scheduling: Onboarding Regular and Clustered Types](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1QxJH0LswctBqtZQVpxTRioybju80iq1jC_DL6Bym1es/edit) proposes concrete and known impact, gaining 5.6% of useful traffic (worth $1mil irev/week).

Further, I want to correct the claim in the pip doc about ‘ how many segments’ not having landed- only one of the UI surfaces had not landed, but the feature was working and publicized to customers since the end of May. This was 90%+ complete, with multiple users having been unblocked (though features less useful than estimated).

Did my best to leave constructive diffs reviews - not many diffs in my area,  the exact engagement on what i write is not in my control  

## Direction

#### ‘100% Coverage’ doc

The document has everything asked for: tldr, current system state overview, useful as a reference on how this works. Touching many parts. I put both concrete execution steps, as well as an overview of the key parts of the system, which was educational for teammates.   

Besides, a lot of commenting on [\[Technical Design Proposal\] CS-BQRT L4 Assignment + WWW API](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1OcZUnMnpD6dI4_Xs6DLXGn_TiNWZEUTEOVt2bLByAcI/edit), adding new functionality on top of scheduler/assignment. 

### Independent execution

I spent a lot of time thinking about messaging; Got a buy-in from the non-sergei TL, who is in charge of the goal we took, and he had no major objections to the text. Then Sergei and Forrest requested multiple iterations. Some of the feedback was very useful, but some seemed unnecessary. Examples- in [the ‘handling ambiguity’](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KIqQ8TmlLlfo4qMHScCvaTigECe-dyMMIZe52_Qvz4c/edit#bookmark=kix.8c8lqp9lhmze) section.

### Vision Doc

Covers many possible angles and viewpoints, from high level customer pain points, to flaws in current system, divides the conceptual landscape in ‘ things common to all scheduling systems’ and ‘things unique to ours’ outlines their boundaries and touchpoints, and proposes a tech execution strategy that would bring the system to coherent state. [\[RFC\] Budget A/B Test Scheduler Roadmap/Vision](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1virCPI2IOGacb1DMOHK6NaZbkPhESr8WmOnGlW62zRQ/edit). Followed proposed structure by Forrest, while thinking hard how to simplify the overview.

### ‘Redesign’  Doc

A lot of participation in [\[RFC\] Budget A/B Test Scheduler Redesign](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/12T_M-GRXyoD-cXvSHkqKqPyqs7njcmdgf_0UpvrBtyg/edit), especially:

1. Pointing out and insisting on addressing tradeoffs between:‘experimenter having certainty  when they get scheduled, and overall throughput.
2. Designing a more detailed technical structure of how schedules should relate to each other to improve traceability (<https://www.internalfb.com/intern/anp/view/?id=5729182>)

And many many discussions, queries, etc

#### ‘20% lost traffic’ 

Pushing to define this as a problem to be solved, despite some initial pushback by the team lead.

- Clusters are important, but take a lot of traffic
    
- Also, latency induces 20-30% traffic loss at-large for cs
    
- Project doesn't seem optimally staffed 
    
- While explaining this to manager, it was suggested by manager I am raising this to complain about high bar of doc quality.
    

#### Facilitate resolving the ‘ which products get traffic’ workstream 

- Clusters are great , but take a ton of traffic 
    
- Other use cases want the traffic, but no way to quantify if it’s ok or moving traffic would affect clusters
    
- Proposed such a way in design doc

[CSBABT Scheduling: Onboarding Regular and Clustered Types](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1QxJH0LswctBqtZQVpxTRioybju80iq1jC_DL6Bym1es/edit) proposes concrete and known impact, gaining 5.6% of useful traffic (worth $1mil irev/week).

Proposed tooling to support [Increasing power of Scaled Lift studies](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/15CWC5asMS7sZWrN5oaZc4HJx2c5ZJrcHsTZNWqZ4VRE/edit) ([CSBABT Scheduling: Onboarding Regular and Clustered Types](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QxJH0LswctBqtZQVpxTRioybju80iq1jC_DL6Bym1es/edit?fbclid=IwY2xjawFOPgdleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHRLu-M-Dk-TcBdoeY7bfoyjhyaCOVMUJFaVTk6yAXjQ-neG96w6pY28Y8g_aem_NwPHiWTP-p3ALDd0CBktqg#bookmark=id.nh26oujd48q1)), quite a large impact ( not by me, but unblocking this workstream in a safe way).

## Project impact

Project execution is on track:  
<https://www.internalfb.com/gsd/1140518516447378/513422614479369/list>

## Engineering Excellence

I made a plan, outlined in the growth doc, to execute:  
Deprecate/rewrite ABQRTConsole.  
repair and expand traffic overlaps dashboard  
(stretch) Simplify clustering pipelines

As requested, closed a sev follow up task, 

I am actively working on reliability topics and ensuring scheduler redesign is sustainable.

Output of pip1 is not broken.

Will make sure to not leave things in review overnight unless it’s needed. 

Additionally, rollout planning for [CSBABT Scheduling: Onboarding Regular and Clustered Types](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1QxJH0LswctBqtZQVpxTRioybju80iq1jC_DL6Bym1es/edit)

## Handling Ambiguity

A lot of curveballs:

- pip written before time off, some things changed
    


- Another person taking control of the area officially, needs convincing
    
- TL having things I would call personal preferences regarding document brevity.
    
- Sometimes topics are complex and stakeholders request a particular and incompatible way to present certain pieces of info. E.g. was asked to delete sections other team members found useful, and to triplicate the same information within the same doc, and then criticized it for getting out of sync, creating unnecessary labor that’s unhelpful.

The purpose of this plan is to provide you with clear direction and guidance on what you need to do to be successful at your level and your role at ​Meta​​     ​. 

​​​Performance Key ​​ 

​​1.​​  ​​Performance Expectations​ - What are the specific expectations of the role that the employee is not meeting?  

​​2.​​  ​​Examples​ - Give specific examples of instances in which the employee did not meet the expectations listed in #1 above. For each example, provide as much detail as possible.  

​​ 3.​  ​​Actions to be Taken​ - What specific actions does the employee need to take to meet or exceed these expectations and avoid further performance management and potentially disciplinary action?   In what other ways can the employee improve their performance and conduct? 

​​​4.  How can the manager help the employee achieve these goals?​ – Provide the employee with specific manager actions that will be taken to support the employee in improving performance to meet and/or exceed expectations.

​Expectations, Examples and Actions​

Below I will comment on a week by week basis in the outcome summary . We will track explicit expectations for the next 4 weeks (these will be annotated with [expectation] tags). Performance relative to expectations will be covered in our weekly 1:1 and color coded with [green] for met, [yellow] for some progress was made but action still needed, [red] missed.

However, after the PIP was over Stefan missed delivery deadlines for his next project, “Number of Segments That Would Fit in a Batch”. This project was not delivered in H1 despite having an original deadline early in June. Therefore, consistency productivity is not being demonstrated.<br>    <br>- In 2024 Stefan has not demonstrated the ability to complete projects of large scope. He has the right setup to do this in the space of scheduling metrics and a scheduler overhaul. He needs to demonstrate this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Scope:<br><br>- [expectation]It is expected that as an IC5 Stefan delivers high-quality design documents and roadmaps with minimal iterations, aligning them with stakeholders (Forrest and Sergei L at a minimum but for scheduling work this should also include Viktor), and doing that quickly enough to have time to land impact. During the PIP this means that all documents of this type should get quality sign-off from the above stakeholders.<br>    <br>- [expectation]Maintain good productivity, landing non-trivial diffs on a weekly basis (in line with what the rest of the team delivers) that contribute towards team projects. <br>    <br>- [expectation]An average of 2 meaningful and constructive diff reviews per week. Note, there might be outlier weeks (in either direction) but I expect that this is the lower-bound average that you are able to achieve.<br>    <br><br>- [expectation]All SEVs owned need to have SLAs met.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Scope:<br><br>Week 1: <br><br>- [expectation] Design docs, roadmaps: minimal iterations, alignment, sign-off.<br>    <br><br>- Design doc created, not yet complete.

Gaps called out by Sergei in technical direction in multiple reviews, e.g. power calculations. Overall quality lower than docs from previous PIP (not a deal-breaker but a regression). Sergei’s feedback is that this required around 2 meetings per week with him in addition to support from other engineers, not minimal iterations. Sergei’s feedback summary is “good content, poor quality”.<br>    <br>- Vision doc created, overall tells a good story but missing impact-focused goals for each half, so it’s not clear it’s worth doing.

Stefan has not demonstrated the ability to deliver high-quality design documents on his own. “High-quality” in this case primarily (but not exclusively) refers to good [technical communication](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/wiki/Engineering_Careers/IC_Career_Hub/Engineering_Skills/#technical-communication): tailoring messages to multiple levels of stakeholders, presenting clear tradeoffs and recommendations, and being proactive.<br>    <br>- Stefan has not yet delivered a full-half roadmap for scheduler work, despite being set up with the seeds of one during his first PIP. This is an example of embracing ambiguity, where he will need to make proposals and align with others on the best way forward, and do this quickly enough to still have time to land impact in 24H2.<br>    <br>- Project progress during the first PIP was unclear. Stefan communicated progress verbally but there was no centralized location to see milestones, expected completion dates, and overall project status. | Direction:<br><br>- [expectation]Stefan needs to deliver a full-half roadmap and design docs for relevant projects, of high quality and with concrete impact, goals, and milestones. The roadmap and at least one new design doc need to be delivered during the PIP in order to have time to land impact in H2. Critically, these also need to be delivered independently, without significant support from others. A rough expectation is that Stefan should have 1 hour of support from Forrest, Sergei K, and others per week and utilize and prioritize what support is needed to help him unblock himself.<br>    <br>- [expectation]Project progress needs to be tracked and surfaced proactively, such that there is a single place to go and view milestones, due dates, work completed so far, any changes to plans, and other material necessary to communicate high-level project status without needing to ask Stefan.<br>    <br>- Demonstrate that you can effectively facilitate or participate in discussions, and make sure outcomes are clear and well-communicated.<br>    <br>- Stefan is expected to continue to work with Forrest and give constructive feedback to help make the team better overall.

No demonstration of use yet but otherwise set up well.<br>    <br><br>Post-PIP<br><br>- The milestones set in the project doc don’t match the durations outlined in the GSD. More importantly, nothing has been landed in the ~6 days since the PIP ended, when the first milestone is only supposed to take two days. The project is still listed as “on track” and no other updates have been provided.

| - I will meet with you once a week to review progress against these goals during the time period of the ​PIP​​     ​. <br>    <br>- I will be available to provide help and guidance in person, or by email, outside of our regularly scheduled one-on-one meetings to help you execute against the above goals when requested. <br>    <br>- I will collect and provide feedback from various stakeholders and internal team members halfway through your PIP. If I receive unsolicited feedback, I will share that feedback with you within a business day. <br>    <br>- |

This performance improvement plan is an opportunity for you to work cooperatively with your manager towards resolving and improving issues of underperformance.  Please note that if you do not address these issues within the stated timelines and in a sustained manner, or if other performance issues arise, you may be subject to further action, which may result in the termination of your employment, in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations 

​​ 

​NOTE: Please make sure you request the employee to acknowledge receipt of the PIP document over a reply email stating “I acknowledge receipt of this email”. ​ 

Warning letter: 

1. Scheduler Project Plan You were required to communicate a clear project plan outlining the

expected outcomes, milestones and timelines. However, your communication lacked a way to get

a high-level async view on milestone completion and expected vs actual task completion dates,

with no easy way to see goals or completed tasks outside of directly asking for project status.

 2\. Scheduler Design Doc “Estimations Before Wednesday Cutoff: You were required to adequately

communicate your project in order for our team TL to sign off on it, and the TL requested a design

doc in order to do this. The first version of the design doc that you presented was lengthy and

unreadable. In particular, it lacked a high-level summary, the narrative of the document was

unclear (what the current problems were, what we could do to solve them, what success looks

like), risks and alternatives weren’t called out.

3. List of outstanding issues: You were asked to provide a list of all unknown outstanding items with

the scheduler by the 3rd of May. The list you initially provided was just a large list of items. It

would have been expected to proactively highlight relevant items and bring clarity tailored to

audiences that wanted to see your recommendations on next steps, categorization of items, and

the way you were thinking about different options.

4. Scheduler Design Doc “Identify # of Segments that would fit in a branch”: You were required to

provide a design doc that at a minimum was of the same quality as the final version of your

previous one (“Estimations Before Wednesday Cutoff”), maintaining the quality standard that you

had previously demonstrated. The first version of the document that you presented was not to

that standard, and presented similar shortcomings as that document’s first version, including

lacking a high-level overview and a complete background summary as well as missing timelines

for milestones.

## Complications

- Mentioned oncall in the beginning, forrest said 'eh its fine', but am happy to hear input. Not changed
    
- 'I want it exactly like this', lowering productivity, examples:  
    Asking to put everything in 'one place' in his doc where i only have ability to comment, can't add pictures in non-laborious way, etc  
    Asking to triplicate the same information within bounds of same design doc, with all 3 pieces having their purpose, then complaining about stuff being out of sync (without asking me).
    
- Working with Viktor  
    Complex system, very different priorities - when we put ops cost vs  overall supply, weight almost 100% on former, resistant to numeric experiments, but still aligned.
