[Some article about it](https://www.msrlab.pitt.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kirk-Johnson-et-al-2019_Perceiving-effort-as-poor-learning.pdf)


People use strategies that work less well during learning. 
Reason is if they feel greater effort,they attribute this to sucking at the task. Thus they feel like
the strategy is bad.

But this interpretation could be wrong, as the greater effort could be related to growth.

Similar to [[Health And Personal Development.Progressive Overload]]. What's the difference, since everyone likes progressive overload? **Measurement is noisy and not instant, maybe?**

So if it feels hard, people think they suck at it. If it feels easy, they think they are good at it. But this is clearly wrong


Effort avoidance hypothesis.

[[Philosophy.Cognitive Biases]]


```
Across these first three studies, a consistent pattern emerged: The more learners perceived a study strategy as mentally effortful,
the less they judged it to be effective for learning; this, in turn, predicted their choice of study strategies such that the more effective
that participants thought a strategy was for learning, the more likely they were to choose it for future study. That is, we observed an
indirect effect of perceived effort on study strategy choices, mediated by perceived learning. This pattern held across differences in
study strategies (the choice between blocked vs. interleaved schedules and the choice between restudy vs. retrieval practice), to-belearned materials (learning to classify category exemplars and learning of science texts), subject populations (students and the
general adult population), and locations (the Web or a laboratory). This indirect effect also always held across both participants’
measures of immediate perceptions of each strategy and retrospective comparisons of the two strategies. It also held even when
controlling for participants’ objective performance during study.

So basically it's supported, though in the previous paragraph it feels like it isn't...

Probably how to think about how the analysis works exactly...s
