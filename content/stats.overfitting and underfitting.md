One sign of overfitting is when the model coefficients increase rapidly and become very large, indicating that the model is fitting to noise and may be at a specific point in an over-specified hyperplane where the solutions lie.


also, this is this is what I wanted to say. Another sign for fitting my bed that you know the training car is going down while the testing error is not going down.

underfit on the other hands from either of fundamental show of the class of functions not being reaching off to capture the data so basically the model of the data we have is not yeah able to explain it or something in the procedure of searching for this parameters did not go great
