**Understand what game the company is playing and how to keep score**

Nobody Asked you to show up!

Engineers build, designers design, marketers make sure people know about it, sales sales, product managers do what?

## Justify your existence.

PM Parts:

1. Idenitfy opportunities- hypothesise
2. Design Iteration


1. Identity right opportunity.
2. Build it
3. Be a **Mini CEO**
4. Feature subsetting: Once the goal is clear, everybody has many ideas. Your part is to decide which one to keep.
5. Trade-off technical debt for pushing things forward. 
6. Pay the technical debt so project doesn't become stuck in inability to execute further.

## Key skills

Technical, communication, industry expertise.

Triangle of

Engineering, Product Management, Design, Marketing.

### How technical?

Somewhat - know how not to be lied to and how to not lie to themselves vis-a-vis technical topics.

### How business-oriented?

Know industry; how businesses make money? What are key players, competitors? What differentiates our company to theirs.

## Types

Production Product Manager- internal, focusing on having things build

Marketing PM- more external, focused on making sure ppl know about product.

### Customer Representative

Customers dont' want to give you money. Customers want to be awesome. You help them be awesome.

#### Company can operate and scale to a point without PM's

# How do PM's get products built?

## Planning Cadence

### Waterfall

Lots of planning, long execution time.

### Agile

fast iteration, MVP's ([[seed.Product Management.Minimum Viable Product]])

### Hybrid (recommended)

Medium planning beforehand to identify opportunity, then fast iteration w/ MVP's

## Product Development Lifecycle

1. Finding and Planning the Right Opportunity
2. Designing the Solution
3. Building the Solution
4. Sharing the Solution
5. Assessing the Solution [[seed.Product Management.Product Metrics]]

### Planning and Opportunity hypothesis

#### **What is the right thing to work on next?**

The core part of the job.
Broken down to:

- [[seed.Product Management.Strategic Understanding of The Company]]

1. Team Capabilities
2. User Needs - be focused

- Create [[seed.Product Management.Opportunity#^create]]
- Validate [[seed.Product Management.Opportunity#^validate]]

### [[seed.Product Management.Product Metrics]]

Select proper metrics.

Consider Company goals, culture, capabilities to filter opportunities.
Ask yourself 'Why does the company exist??'

After identifying the right opportunity, you need to [[seed.Product Management.Opportunity#^validate]] validate it.

After validating, need to turn it into something build-able.

## Product Goals ^companygoals

See Also [[seed.Product Management.UX Research and KPI's#^heart]]

Broadly, product goals could be in 3 main categories:

1. Revenue: 
   How does the company currently monetize it's products? How do you make them more valuable to customers to make them more willing to pay for the product.
    

2. User Satisfaction : do you want users to be happier
   What can you deliver that they would love, but couldn't expect?

3. Growth : Do you want more customers
   What's stopping the customers from using the product? What is lacking in the product to reduce friction?

In addition, a company should consider it's context, i.e. what it excels at, what it can't do as well, what it's competitors are doing and what is the market share.

This is covered in: 
[[seed.Product Management.Strategic Understanding of The Company]]

- What is the company building now?

- Who are the key customers you want to solve a problem for?

- What do you excel at, compared to it's competitors?

- What's the company vision, and more importantly, why does the company exist?

## Creating Oportunity Hypothesis

How to get good ideas?

[[seed.Product Management.Opportunity#^hypothesis]]

Current [[seed.Product Management.Product Metrics]] could help you identify the right opportunity.

Look at the metrics to on how users are using the product. What are they engaging with?
Does this contradict with data from surveys?

For example, it might be that in a CNN app users engage more with videos that text articles. Maybe they watch the whole video,
but dont' scroll down as much. This is an **opportunity** to make them engage more with the content (and show more ads).

### Scoping and [[seed.Product Management.Minimum Viable Product]] ^scoping

Define goals and non-goals.
Clearly define the opportunity, customers you want to target (and don't want to target), and product requirements .

Example:

Opportunity:

Build a Pen

Customers:
Students

Non-goals
I don't need it to work in space or underwater? But it's good if it works upside-down?

Create [[seed.Product Management.Minimum Viable Product]].

contrast MVP-driven vs waterfall development.
Comment on hardware vs software projects.

[[seed.Product Management.Design Document]]

#### Designing

Wireframes, user research [[seed.Product Management.Personas]].
Survery, user testing. 
Wireframes are clickable, w/ fake data.
Investigate layout and information ordering.

### Building

Taking on technical debt- must manage that, considering current needs (i.e. build this now) vs future development
cadence and flexibility.

Related to

- Prioritizing buglss

- Testing Software

- Do whatever's needed to help product ship

- **NOT** writing code or telling people what to write.

- Design might figure out most common use cases, but many edge cases will appear.

- Find ways to share prototypes/MVP's to get feedback.

- Negotiate taking on tehcnical debt.

- New information about technologies/competitor features.

Building is done when a working product has been tested and is ready to release.

### Sharing the Solution

[[seed.Product Management.Product Marketing]]

Let customers know how the product would help them.
More PMM(Product Marketing Management)- externally focused.

Even before [[seed.Product Management.Product School Book#scoping-and-seedproduct-managementminimum-viable-product]] you should kno wthe 'why ' of the product. 

What problem does it solve?
Succinctly and effectively communicate what problem is being solved and how it 
helps the customer **be awesome**.
Storytelling/[[seed.Product Management.Messaging]]

CNN Example:
360 VR view- ???
Rather, say 'be on the ground/scene with our reporters!'

Also, here we plan the release.

- Plan Beta Test
  \*Create marketing assets for web/ads
- briefing press, launch events, etc

Many things to let people know about the product.

### Assessing Solution Impact

At least 2 Parts
Most importantly, Product impact:

- Would you success in hitting [[seed.Product Management.Product Metrics]] targets?
- assess how the product is being used/recieved by customers, etc.

'Process' metrics
Assess how the process went internally and how people feel about it.

- Postmortem about dev process- how does team feel, are they quitting, tec
- What are the updates about our (Bayesian) belief in team strength how do we use that to re-assess for the future?
- Deadlines, budget, etc
