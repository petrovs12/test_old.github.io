# Description
## input
history of posts that the user saw and either liked or not.

design a model to predict p(like | user, post).

# Possible Solutions


## Embedding content based
[[science.stats.Deep Neural Networks.Embeddings]]
[[science.stats.Deep Neural Networks.Multi Modality]]

## Profile based approach
interst type of problem and then we try to assign to a user a list of its interest, possibly probabilities so you could say it is a multi-label classification problem.

How to do large scale, topic, modeling maybe one should mention, for example, saying supervised learning based on Wikipedia scraping.
