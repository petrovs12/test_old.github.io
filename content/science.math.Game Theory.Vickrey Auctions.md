[Lecture](https://web.stanford.edu/~jdlevin/Econ%20285/Vickrey%20Auction.pdf)

* We consider the problem of how to implement eÂ¢ cient allocations in
an environment where each participant has private information about
their preferences. Participants may misrepresent their preferences.
* A bank may overstate its need for a federal bailout, hoping to get
taxpayers to absorb its losses.
* A buyer might understate its value, hoping to get a lower price.
VCG mechanisms achieve __*strategy-proof*__ implementation of efficient cient
allocations in quasi-linear environments, but can have trouble with
budget balance.
