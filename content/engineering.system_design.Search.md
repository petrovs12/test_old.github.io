Three basic stages of search : 
**crawling** â€“ where  discover pages; 
**indexing** - normalize text from pages and make it easier to search
\_\_retrieval -get a list of relevant search results.

Scan sites, get links, put in queue(#BFS), get content, images, etc, store in database. 
Maybe cache a copy of page

# Indexing

# Retrieval/Searching

 Ranking algorithm is trade secret, but we know about pagerank, etc.
