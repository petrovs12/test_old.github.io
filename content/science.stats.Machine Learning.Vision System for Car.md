So far a vision system for driving car we may want to cover as follows first what kind of objects do we want to recognize and why what is the downstream task? How do you get training data? Might use a fleet of instrument vehicles what are the latest or computer requirements? How do we design the evaluation both online evaluation and off-line evaluation how to detect problems and co how to get labels or self supervised signal.

 can we mine for relevant data?

 how to detect data and domain drift?
