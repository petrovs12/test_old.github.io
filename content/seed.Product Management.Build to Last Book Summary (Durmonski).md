- Figure out what things should change and what shouldn't
- Exist beyond making money (as in [[seed.Product Management.Product School Book]])
- Core Values and Mission Statement should be Constant
- Practices can change 

 'Engineering' mindset - build up something that doesn't need you .
 [[Philosophy and Rationality.Knowledge Should be Public]]

 Chasing a single project is a 'time-telling' action; creating a system - building a clock- can tell time forever.

 Visionary company - needs to stand for something AND this needs to kind of be baked into the culture (i.e. how the organization itself runs), products, and services.

 Spend more time thinking about organization design.
 Thinking about 'identity' of the organization.

# Everything can change, except the core ideology

# Be like a cult (but hopefully good one)

 If people believe they're just working for another company, we'll be just another company.

# Continous improvement

If you are a perfectionist, you'll never publish anything. If you don't publish anything,you'll never be in business. 

If you're in business, users will drive you towards perfection.
