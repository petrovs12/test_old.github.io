I am excited to apply for the Senior Python Backend/Machine Learning Engineer position at Canva. With my experience as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Meta, I have successfully ported experimental Python code to scalable and testable production systems, optimized machine learning code for performance, and deployed models within internal AWS-equivalents. I have also worked in AWS previously . My role also involved interfacing various backend systems, including ML, with each other which aligns with the requirements of this position.


At Meta I matured as an engineer by seeing (and practicing)  identifying and removing organizational barriers in order to move fast and unblock people while building tooling to stabilize the relevant infrastructure. Additionally, in the last year I have focused on technical communication, updating documentation, and sharing best practices to facilitate high-quality engineering culture, scope out projects for myself and others.
The impact of these efforts is described in the CV for example.
I don't have formal education in HCI, but I'm deeply interested in it. I like making and trying to use new tools, and I'm deeply interested in ergonomics- what is the best way to expose a given piece of functionality. For example, many of the tooling, mentioned in the CV, both in Transmetrics and Meta, combine math modeling and interaction design- how exactly are people going to use that? 

This makes me confident in my ability to contribute effectively to Canvaâ€™s team.
