The Stanley Reiter diagram above illustrates a game of mechanism design. The upper-left space $\Theta$  depicts the type space and the upper-right space $X$ the space of outcomes. The social choice function $f(\theta )$ maps a type profile to an outcome. In games of mechanism design, agents send messages $M$ in a game environment $g$. The equilibrium in the game $\xi (M,g,\theta )$ can be designed to implement some social choice function $f(\theta )$.
