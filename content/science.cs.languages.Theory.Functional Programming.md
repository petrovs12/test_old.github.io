Oh yeah. I have heard that spreadsheets are purely functional programs with full referential transparency 
and also-also I think they re-implemented excel in F# in like a hackathon in Cambridge MS research
and then this was expanded to a bigger project, where the F# code compiles to typescript and this then is MS excel 365
whereas b4 it would open a new VM on Azure and will be super slow
might be murky on the details, reference here:
