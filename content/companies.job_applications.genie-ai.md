Hello, Charlette,

I am interested in this position, because the domain seems novel, interesting, and in an area that seems highly impactful and I can learn a lot about. 

'Immersing' myself in the world of law' seems appealing and I'm curious about the problems. I listened to podcast, discussing how with recent LLM's surpassing average human performance on many tasks, LLM's require data, generated by top specialists, which is quite expensive for your domain! Would love to learn more.

I think I can contribute a lot due to:
 * track record of applying ML and analytics to complex domains (Ads, Transporttion, finance, gambling)
 * focus on solving the business problem, starting from the customer problem- did that with several internal products at meta; had to iterate a lot to get it done
 * experience in building, deploying models to prod, setting up monitoring, debugging complex issues
 *  scrappiness- Meta, despite being a huge company, operates as a collection of coupled startups
 * can adapt to any reasonable tech stack, and think excellent engineering is a prerequisite for working ML product- hacky solutions are so hard to debug they cripple velocity at some point
 * can own projects end-to-end, from defining the problem to monitoring the model in prod
 
 If interested to discuss, feel free to book a meeting here:
