#TODO - check out the [Brilliant Article](https://brilliant.org/wiki/conservative-forces/)

Work Done:

$W = \F*d$ (when F is constant, etc)

Work done formula:

$WD =  \int \bold{F}\cdot d \bold{r}$

A conservative force is a force whose work done is independent of the path it took.

Classical example: Kinetic energy+ potential energy.

Path independence of concervative forces: additional

Gravity is a concervative force.

Friction is non-concervative.

Properties of concervative forces: defines

# Test Path-independence DIRECTLY

$\int_{A,p_1}^{B} F\cdot r=  \int_{A,p_2}^{B} F\cdot d$
For every $p_1,p_2$ between A and B.

# Loop property

Check that the work around a loop is 0.

# A concervative force is the gradient of something (Energy)

if a force field can be expressed as $\vec f = \nabla \bold F$

Proof:

I guess the fundamental theorem of algebra (?)

# A concervative field has a curl of 0

So that is:

if 
$\vec f =h*\vec x+i*\vec y+j*\vec z$

$(\frac{d j}{dy}-\frac{d i}{dz})\vec x+(\frac{dh}{dz}-\frac{dj}{dx})\vec y+(\frac{di}{dx}-\frac{dh}{dy})\vec z=0$

 Proof- Stokes theorem .
