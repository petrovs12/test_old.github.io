I'm not sure like basically what they learn about this board hippo geometric spaces. There are two things or three points first point it's kind of the continuous and I'll analog of a three second so they post too late. The changes the Euclid and fourth action is that given as a we are liking some kind of pla in this hippo plane basically given a line and a point, which is not the line there is two lines through this point which do not intersect the first line meaning that I mean, for example it's kind of folded in certain way or folded in a certain way so that they might not not interseand sold then the third point is that there is this kind of point in  in a tree and embedding which we can use to sort of define objective function for hierarchy-compliant classification basically.
