[Typeahead suggestion](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1X2E-llNZg0q9qga7JssUwsoVwiAJwWcBo-F-zWcHFg4/edit).


Idea:
Use Distributed [[science.CS.algos.Data Structures.Trie (Prefix Tree)]] and augment each node with  pointers to the the top K most frequent __words__  among the descendants.

Have some batch job that periodically updates these top K words
