Firmware is software that's embedded in a piece of hardware. Think **software for hardware**.

From (wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware].

Examples:

 BIOS of a computer: defines basic functions of a device, providing hardware abstraction services to higher level software such as OS.

From Wikipedia again:

Hardware abstractions are sets of routines in software that provide programs with access to hardware resources through programming interfaces. The programming interface allows all devices in a particular class C of hardware devices to be accessed through identical interfaces even though C may contain different subclasses of devices that each provide a different hardware interface.
