questions:
a. What's up with you? what's the state of the company,
b. where are you with the eng problem? what kind of models are you creating?
c. idk, what's the state of the art?
d. what's your main problem? have you solved the science problem?
e. is this your main issue?


you wrote stuff to theona with some concerns, can you elaborate?

riday?:)  
  
In any case, I was discussing some points with him and wanted to revert back to you on this as well. He's already been in the ML/Operations Research domain in the transportation and logistics domain, and it's quite different from what they do now from what he mentioned, so wanted me to double check if this is something you're really keen on considering?  
  
With your profile, it might be a hard time with the introductory screening test which usually centers around computer vision and diffusion models and I know we discussed you don't have expert exposure into this, more so on the user end? Not putting it past anybody in any case, but you'd have to really want this basically  
  
So essentially he mentioned the potential challenges based on the context so far and wanted to see if you're really keen given this info and would be something you're interested in and comfortable with ? Aka a specific interest to move into computer vision and generative AI would be a bare minimum for them at this point in time :
