SWE Screen
SWE Screen


PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW

It is important to understand that the Screening interview is different than the Coding (Ninja) and Intern interviews.

The SWE Screen interview is an initial assessment to determine if a candidate should proceed to a  full loop. You should rely on Focus Area assessments (see Focus Areas below) and quantifiable signals (e.g., coding ability, problem solving) to determine whether a candidate should proceed to a full loop.



We are no longer using “25% chance of passing a loop” as guidance. Current guidance is below. Starting in December, 2022 interviewers will see a recommended option in the SIFT tool based on this guidance.  Interviewers can override the tool’s suggested decision, but will be required to provide reasoning for doing so.

If the interviewer gives a Rating of Moderate (2) or better on BOTH Problem Solving and Coding AND Moderate or higher on either Communication or Verification, then the tool will recommend a “yes” for the candidate proceeding to full loop.


Please use this direct link to access the vetted coding questions for the SWE Screen in the IQB. In order to assess these Focus Areas, you will ask two coding questions from a set of vetted questions for the screen interview.



FOCUS AREAS

(SWE) Problem Solving: Analyzes the problem space, generates solutions to open-ended problems, and evaluates the relative quality (e.g., time and space complexity, simplicity) of potential solutions.
(SWE) Coding: Translates identified solutions into working code in preferred or required language. Leverages technical knowledge and coding language fluency to write readable and organized code.
(SWE) Verification: Verifies that the solution and implementation work as intended and meet specifications for a given problem while leveraging test or edge cases. Identifies and fixes problems with the code as necessary.
(SWE) Communication: Communicates technical information clearly and concisely. Asks clarifying questions as necessary and demonstrates active listening.
Ahead of the interview, please familiarize yourself with the Focus Area Assessment Scales you will use to evaluate each focus area below.



RATING GUIDANCE

Provide written Focus Area feedback about the candidate in the structured feedback tool.
Rate each Focus Area using the following Focus Area Assessment Scale
Insufficient: Responses indicate significant gaps in proficiency
Moderate: Responses indicate proficiency with some gaps
Solid: Responses satisfy basic requirements
Strong: Responses indicate significant proficiency
Exceptional: Responses indicate outstanding proficiency
Cannot Assess → Didn’t ask questions for a given focus area and therefore can’t make an assessment
Cannot Assess → Observations too limited: Questions were asked for a given focus area, however answers were not substantial enough to support an assessment
Overall Assessment - After making your focus area assessments, you will be asked the question: “Based on your assessment of these focus areas, should the candidate proceed to the next stage of the interview process?” You have two options:
“Yes” - if you think a candidate has a chance at passing the full loop.
“No” - if the candidate did not demonstrate sufficient signal across most of the focus areas assessed in the interview. If this candidate received a “Meets Criteria” final decision from the full loop panel, you'd argue against hiring them.
Provide a narrative summary of the interview.
Remember: Being lenient at Screen does not lower our overall expectation, instead, it increases opportunity for more qualified and diverse candidates to pass through to full loop, giving more candidates an opportunity to demonstrate proficiency across interview roles.


INTERVIEW STRUCTURE AND SCHEDULING
The SWE screen is the first evaluative interview a candidate has. The coordinator has emailed a Coderpad link to the candidate ahead of time, so you don’t need to send an email yourself. Remember to click “end interview” within Coderpad so that TC cannot go back and rewrite their answer after the interview ends.

Introduction: 2 - 3 Minutes - Introduce yourself and put the candidate at ease. Share your background and your team. Make sure the candidate has at least 45 minutes free and the Coderpad link is working.
Coding Questions: 37 - 38 Minutes - Ask your 2 coding questions from the list of vetted SWE screen questions to get clear signal on the SWE focus areas.
Pick two questions that will fill 37-38 minutes. People often ask if you should pick two easy, or one medium and one easy, or two medium---don't think about it this way. Pick two questions which a good candidate can do in 37-38 minutes. If the time split is 19/19 or 11/26, it doesn't really matter. What you must have is a hard stop for the first question. Set a hard upper bound and cut over to the second question no matter what, and no matter how close the candidate seems to an answer to the first question if they reach that point. Candidates can stay tantalizingly close to the answer for tens of minutes; resist the temptation to give them more time, since it just hurts their chances on the second question.
Q&A: 5 Minutes - If they don’t have any questions for you, use this time to tell them about your experience at Meta. You should sell candidates on Meta regardless of how they performed in the interview. We want to ensure each candidate has a good candidate experience.
Carve out time directly after the interview to refine and write your feedback. You should take notes during the interview, but you will need time to clean those notes up and assess the candidate on each focus area. Getting screening feedback in promptly is crucial to moving candidates through our interview process in a timely manner, and could be the difference between an offer acceptance or decline .
Submit your feedback within 24 calendar hours (not business hours, calendar hours) of the interview.



Unauthorized Outside Assistance Guidance: Please refer to this direct link for guidance on what to look for and what specific actions to take regarding a candidate potentially using unauthorized outside assistance during the interview (e.g., using LLMs / generative AI tools, receiving help from others, consulting other external resources).


TECHNICAL LOGISTICS
Recruiting/CoderPad is the recommended shared editor for writing and reviewing code; see that page for how to login and create a new session.

Make an External Phone Call
You should not need to call the candidate directly - please use BlueJeans. But if BlueJeans is down or not working, you might want to switch to the telephone network:

From a gizmo panel: On the touch panel choose the Phone icon on the home screen and dial the area code - number provided. (Use "011" for international calls if located in the US. In London the international prefix is "900")
From a mobile phone: Dial *67 1 - area code - number (*67 will allow your phone number to show as private for outgoing calls)

WRITING FEEDBACK
Meta SLA is 24 hours. If feedback is not submitted on time your interview status will be paused. Moving fast in the recruiting process is a great way to show candidates that moving fast is Meta’s reality and not just a slogan.

Please include the following in your feedback:

Focus area assessments, decisions, and notes that provide specific evidence of what you saw and heard.
Any particular technical specialty or domain interest of the candidate which should influence their loop construction. We mostly hire generalists, but if you think they should meet specialized interviewers (like Android/iOS/ML/kernel) please note that. Also helpful to note if you think they are likely to prefer working on product features, back-end systems, or full stack. This helps us make sure they meet the right interviewers at full loop, who can best evaluate their expertise and best sell them on the cool work at Meta in their area. Some of our most embarrassingly bad candidate experiences have come from a loop that's a bad fit for the candidate.
Your feedback will be reviewed by the recruiter and a loop approver (another engineer, often a manager) who also has access to references, recruiter's pre-screen notes, etc. Where there is a loop approver they will use your screening feedback and the other inputs to make a final decision on next steps and will help select the full loop of interviewers.



PHONE SCREEN TRAINING

We use shadows to train new interviewers. This works pretty much exactly like onsite shadows for in-person screening interviews (aka "the initial onsite.") Do tell the candidate there is someone observing the interview for training purposes. There is no need to tell the candidate who is the trainee or trainer.
There is no Reverse Shadow needed for a screen.


EVALUATION CRITERIA

Please note, the example behaviors below should be used as a guide to “self-calibrate” on what types of behaviors are associated with different focus area assessment ratings. This is not an exhaustive list of all behaviors that interviewers may observe during the interview.

The evaluation criteria are on a 5-point rating scale: Insufficient (1), Moderate (2), Solid (3), Strong (4), and Exceptional (5). Interviewers will be able to select any of those ratings for each focus area, even though only the 1-3-5 ratings are shown below.

Solid: Discusses tradeoffs (e.g., run-time, space complexity, user experience) for proposed solutions, with or without prompting; makes appropriate decisions regarding data structures to leverage for a given problem
Exceptional: Makes informed decisions about potential solutions based on multiple tradeoffs (e.g., time and space complexity, theoretical/practice issues, user experience); shares thoughtful rationale and reasoning to support decisions regarding specific data structures that could best solve for a given problem


Focus Area: (SWE) Coding

Writes code that implements identified solution to problem

Insufficient: Produces incorrect code for the common-case scenario that does not solve for the problem
Solid: Produces code that solves for the common-case scenario and for identified bugs (if any); may miss a few relevant corner cases
Exceptional: Coded solution covers both common-case scenario as well as potential edge cases; fixes problems in a scalable and logical way

= General Tips & Recommendations =

If you're new to technical interviewing, you are encouraged to ask questions that other people at Meta are familiar with. If you ask a question from the list below and aren't sure how to calibrate a candidate's performance, another engineer can help you.

You should always attempt to go through [[Engineering/Interviewing/Coding_(SWE_Ninja)/Ninja/AskTwo/|two coding questions]]. Most interviewers, especially inexperienced interviewers, are better served familiarizing themselves with atleast three to five Coding questions so they have backup if the candidate has already been asked one of those questions previously.

The Signals portion of this page covers the 4 basic signals interviewers should be looking for when conducting a Coding interview. Meta has a great recruiting flow because candidates have a good experience, even when we don't hire them. This guide also contains advice to make candidates have a pleasant experience.

==How to Train, Shadowing + Reverse Shadowing==

* NORAM coreSWE Engineers: [[Engineering/Eng_Interviewing_Home/coreSWE_Interviewing/|See coreSWE wiki on how to get started if you have not been interview trained yet]] 
**You must have attended the Eng Interview Training Fundamentals (EIT) class. Program Managers manage attendance and remove engineers who have signed up on the waitlist on a first come first served basis
** After attending the EIT class you will receive the SWE Coding role + SWE-generalist-interviewers tag on your dashboard

(GLOBAL) After receiving the role on your dashboard, you will need to complete a Shadow + Reverse Shadow. 
* [[https://www.internalfb.com/intern/wiki/Engineering/Interviewing/Coding_(SWE_Ninja)/Coding_(SWE_Ninja)_reverse_shadower_script/ Reverse Shadower Rubric (for trainers) ]]
* [[https://fb.quip.com/81lNAvCqbHad Reverse Shadow Checklist]]
= Goals of the Interview =

Your goals as a SWE Coding interviewer are:
# Get signal
# Make sure the candidate has a good experience
# Submit feedback in a timely manner

Getting signal is hard. There are lots of tradeoffs that you can make as an interviewer to extract more signal.


= Interview Structure = 

''ALL SWE Coding interviews are Language Agnostic, the candidate should choose the language'''
The general interview structure is:

* 1 minute of intro. Outline the interview structure, introduce yourself, ask if the candidate needs a bathroom/snack/beverage break, set expectations
* 10-15 minutes: Warmup question.
* 20-25 minutes: Followup question.
* 5 minutes: Q&A Session with the candidate, wrap up, introduce next interviewer
* '''Hit 'End Interview' in CoderPad'''

You should always know beforehand how much time to spend on a question. Don't let a candidate spend all 40 minutes on a 10 minute easy icebreaker. If they aren't making progress, pivot to a new question and let them know early on that you will be keeping the interview on track so you may interrupt them. 

You also always need to reserve 5 minutes at the end for the candidate to ask you any questions about Meta. This is their time, not yours. Not only does it give them opportunity to ask you any questions (after all, interviews are a two way street), but it also gives them time to rest and catch up between interviews.

= During the Interview =

For SWE Coding we generally recommend against discussing the candidate's background and current projects in detail. The purpose of the interview is to gather coding signal.

*Remember not to ask any [[Engineering/Interviewing/Illegal_questions/|illegal questions]]
*We want the candidate to have a good experience: they should feel like you are engaged and that they have your full attention
** Tell the candidate at the start of the interview that you will be taking some notes
** Remain focused on the candidate, stay engaged, turn off notifications
* Make sure the candidate clearly understands the problem(s) you're posing. Some ways to do this: 
** Write an example on the board 
** If you walked through an example yourself, then change the example a little bit before asking the candidate to walk through the example, otherwise they are just regurgitating what you initially said
** Once you are done, explicitly ask the candidate if they understand the problem
** Answer clarifying questions in detail. Unlike hints, there is no advantage to beating around the bush
* Avoid giving explicit hints. If the candidate is clearly stuck, pivot the question and situation to ensure you're able to gather enough signal in the short amount of time
** It's often tempting to help the candidate along when they are very close to a correct solution. However, the goal of the interview is to assess the candidate's performance, not to get to a working solution
* A Candidate might know that the standard library or some common open source package has some trivial functionality they wish to use but doesn't remember the specific syntax. For example, splitting a string by a delimiter in C++. Tell them to assume the functionality exists and move on with writing code
* If the candidate sees a less efficient solution first, it might be
useful to have them write code for this, rather than encouraging them to move
on to a more efficient solution
* In some cases the candidate may often sense that there is probably a more
efficient solution, and may want to go ahead and move onto it rather than
implementing a simple algorithm first.  This is fine, but if the candidate ends
up spending more than 5 minutes or so and hasn't worked out an optimal solution
maybe ask them to continue working onand implement a less
efficient algorithm first
* Use examples to expose bugs, but remember perfect code is not the goal
** Even if you think their code is correct, walking through an example can occasionally expose bugs that you and the candidate both missed. (But if the code is correct and simple, you might be better off spending the time on something else)
** A great way to get into this for experienced hires is to ask, "How would you test this?" 


= Choosing Your Questions =
Only choose questions from the '''[https://www.internalfb.com/intern/recruiting/interview/questions/?title=&types%5B0%5D= Coding Interview Questions Bank ] '''. They can easily be filtered by interview type and difficulty. 

When starting out, asking a question from the '''Coding Deep Dive sessions''' [https://facebook.csod.com/samldefault.aspx?ReturnUrl=%252fDeepLink%252fProcessRedirect.aspx%253fmodule%253dlodetails%2526lo%253d9f258deb-4167-4861-82b2-60297c7677f6 (sign up here)] is a good idea because you can watch the videos or attend the sessions and be sure you have plenty of context on the question before asking it. 
*[https://fburl.com/020tbaxg Intern search for SWE Coding videos]

You should aim to ask '''two questions''' during the interview (https://fburl.com/AskTwo) and prefer to have them cover different topics (e.g. don't ask two tree questions or two array questions). This will minimize the chance that the candidate happens to have a knowledge gap in a single area that everyone tested.

=Signal Areas=

FBUrl to this section: https://fburl.com/ninja_generic_signals

These are the four basic signals we expect from every successful '''Coding Interview'''. Breakdown of these signals and details on how you captured them during the interview should also be included in your feedback. Take a look at [[Engineering/Interviewing/WritingGoodFeedback|Writing Good Feedback]] to ensure your written feedback is valuable for Candidate Review and Debrief.

'''Note''': Candidate leveling is NOT part of a coding interview. The coding bar is independent of candidate target level. The same standard is held for interns.

|- 
|}
= At the End/After the Interview =

'''Be sure to END ON TIME'''. Even if your interview started late, you should still end on time. Otherwise the delays will just keep adding up after each loop. Remember, the goal is simply to assess the candidate's coding abilities, not to get all the way through a complete solution.

== Wrapping up and Q&A==

Spend the last 5 minutes answering any questions the candidate may have for you.
If the candidate doesn't have any questions, or runs out of questions before the next interviewer shows up, spend time selling: talk about interesting things you like about Meta, your current project, your first impressions of the company when you joined, etc.

==Feedback==

Submit feedback in 24 calendar hours (it's the expected SLA). 
* Address all axes
* Detail time spent on each question
* Hire/no hire decision with confidence

Take a look at [[Engineering/Interviewing/WritingGoodFeedback|Writing Good Feedback]] to ensure your written feedback is valuable for Candidate Review and Debrief. Ensure you address all signal areas.
