Mariane's pros/cons

```markdown
Looking at your pros and cons I think it was this for us:

Pro
•⁠  ⁠tall enough ceiling/doors for Gregor, he doesn’t have to crouch
•⁠  ⁠⁠community/neighbors
•⁠  ⁠⁠KiGa and public schools across the street, several bilingual schools not far
•⁠  ⁠⁠modern, neubau, quiet, closer to U1, two parking spots (very rare)
•⁠  ⁠⁠safety of children due to the ‘closed gate community’ and all kids are same age (under 7)
•⁠  ⁠⁠farm fresh food across the street (it’s been going for hundreds of years or something? Including vending machine of fresh local farm meat and eggs)
•⁠  ⁠⁠cemetery/protected area so nothing will be built on top or can’t look down on us in future. Also the street is just really pretty
•⁠  ⁠⁠no vis a vis looking into neighbors windows and they can’t look into ours (hard To find in Vienna)
•⁠  ⁠⁠shared community garden
•⁠  ⁠⁠ready to install solar, AC and underfloor heating already installed 
•⁠  ⁠⁠nice furniture/kitchen, ready to live with minimal intervention
•⁠  ⁠⁠dedicated pantry and laundry chute
•⁠  ⁠⁠very good for biking


Con
•⁠  ⁠cemetery bells
•⁠  ⁠⁠small garden, needs wall for privacy (we will install)
•⁠  ⁠⁠2 bedrooms (we wanted 3, basement room was a fine compromise)
•⁠  ⁠⁠technically maisonette, not einfamilienhaus or reihenhaus
•⁠  ⁠⁠21st district less central than 10th, though seems to have a similarish vibe in terms of the population 
•⁠  ⁠⁠ten min walking to metro (but tbh it’s the nicest/closest we could find to a metro without needing to take a bus or drive)
•⁠  ⁠⁠bike room is underground
•⁠  ⁠⁠parking is uncovered
•⁠  ⁠⁠park across the street (in front) is nice with pond but no playground, playgrounds are a bit further but about 10 min walking
•⁠  ⁠⁠further away from what we like in the 10th (you guys, brothers, Balkan bakery, Mr nam)

Hi, Corinna, this is Stefan Petrov from yesterday.
Thanks for the tour and great company yesterday, we are really impressed.
 We think the house is very nice. We’re currently discussing whether it fits with our life plans, so I request for a bit more time (not months, maybe a week or 2).
  2 questions:
   May I ask how is your timeline on your end, i.e. are you having many visitations, how is the interest level and so on? We have many things going on here too.
   Also, if we want to come back without Miko, what time would be good for you?
