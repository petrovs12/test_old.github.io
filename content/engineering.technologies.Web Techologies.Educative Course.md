Using [[science.cs.languages.python.libraries.Flask]], [[engineering.system_design.SQL Databases#^postgres]] and [[engineering.technologies.Web Techologies.React]].

| Synchronous | Asyncronous |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Phone Call  | Email       |

# Single vs Multipage applications

## **Multi-page applications** : server sends a new page every time the user does something

## **Single-page applications**: servers sends only the relevant data, client updates itself

# RESTful API

Server doesn't know the state, but client can keep track of the state as much as you like.

I.e. **stateless** is like [[science.cs.languages.Theory.Functional Programming]], rather than OOP (at least from the server's perspective).
