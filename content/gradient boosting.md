gradient boosting:



 the gradient boosting method assume serial value why it takes an approximation F in the form of a weighted sum of M functions from some class called base or week learners if equals weight some of age we usually give a training set of no value in accordance with them risk immunisation principle the metal strike to find approximation of that minimise the value of the lost function of the training set. I minimise the empirical risks. It does so by starting by more consistent of the constant function and incremental.
