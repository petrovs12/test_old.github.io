[Learning math](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_03_06.html)

Symbolic roles: 
not the goal


Conceptual understanding comes **after** a considerable amout of **procedurial practice**.


So this is similar to the [[learning.Understanable Input Approach (Language Learning)]] to language learning, probably (?)

Loosely related also to the algorithmic questions in interviews...

Check if the practice is there first. Hard to fake...


This guy thinks practice comes before conceptual understanding.

Kind of opposite to [[learning.Bloom's Taxonomy]].

Idea here is that the brain is wired to do procedures, and not for abstract thoughts...




Life in today's society requires that we acquire many skills without associated understanding - driving a car, operating a computer, using a VCR, etc. Becoming a better driver, computer user, etc. often requires understanding the technology (and perhaps also the science behind it). But from society's perspective (and in many cases the perspective of the individual), the most important thing is the **initial mastery of use**.
