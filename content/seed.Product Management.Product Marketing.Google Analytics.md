Analytics conversions have been renamed **key events**

To distinguish conversions in Google Analytics from those in Google Ads, Analytics conversions are now called **key events** [[conversion]].

You don’t need to take any action on your existing setup. Key events are created and reported the same way as previous conversions in Google Analytics.

If you have a linked Google Ads account, Google Ads conversions created from Analytics key events appear as **conversions** in the Analytics advertising section.

**Key events** in Google Analytics measure the interactions most important to your business. For example, you could mark an important event like a purchase or newsletter subscription as a key event. This will appear as a key event metric in Analytics reports.

**Conversions can be created from key events** to help measure and optimize your ad campaigns. These conversions are shared between Google Ads and Google Analytics for consistent reporting, and are eligible for bidding in Google Ads.
