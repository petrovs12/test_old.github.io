## You have opinions, not facts

## 'Average' fallacy.

- People think they are 'average' in the sense they are the 'mode' of the distribution on a given topic. Therefore if they want something, many other people would want it too.

## Testing ideas

 Amazon tests all ideas, &lt;50% of even very good 'first principle' ideas fail

What does it mean to **fail**? To not move the metrics you set out in the beginning in the desired direction.

- Have to figure out we're wrong **quickly**.
- An idea could be **good**, but not helpful for you or your customers.
- Businesses that start with the business plan and product development, rather than **validate** their fundamental idea, tend to fail.
