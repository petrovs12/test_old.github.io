I am deeply interested in how AI and data science can drive better healthcare outcomes, particularly in improving diagnostic tools and patient care workflows. XUND’s focus on products like Symptom Check, Illness Check, and Health Check aligns well with my expertise in machine learning, statistics, and optimization. I’m particularly excited about contributing to areas involving patient monitoring and risk assessments, where advanced data-driven models can play a significant role in enhancing prediction accuracy and optimizing healthcare delivery processes, adding tangible value to both patients and healthcare providers.

My recent experience at Meta has given me a great deal of engineering maturity, particularly in scaling solutions and organizational engineering. Seeing many examples of what 'removing bottlenecks' means in practice gave me a mindset, which could be quite valuable particularly at the scale-up stage. Streamlining workflows would also be areas where I can contribute significantly.
