# About This Digital Garden

Welcome to my digital garden! This is where I share my notes, thoughts, and learnings about various topics including:

- Mathematics and Statistics
- Machine Learning and Data Science
- System Design and Engineering
- And more...

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a collection of notes, essays, and ideas that grow over time. Unlike traditional blogs, digital gardens:

- Are living documents that evolve
- Don't have to be perfect or complete
- Show connections between different ideas
- Grow organically over time

## How This Site Works

This site is built using:
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note-taking
- [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) for publishing
- GitHub Pages for hosting

Feel free to explore the interconnected notes and thoughts!
