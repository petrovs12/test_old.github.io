[I think it should not be done!!!](https://medium.com/@peterflom/why-binning-continuous-data-is-almost-always-a-mistake-ad0b3a1d141f).
The reasons to discretize a real-valued numerical feature can be numerous. For example, some
feature selection techniques only apply to categorical features.

```

Binning or discretization is used for the transformation of a continuous or numerical variable into a categorical feature. Binning of continuous variable introduces non-linearity and tends to improve the performance of the model. It can be also used to identify missing values or outliers.
There are two types of binning:
Unsupervised Binning: Equal width binning, Equal frequency binning
Supervised Binning: Entropy-based binning

```
