In practice extremely similar to [[science.stats.Regression]].

ML is more of a 'curve-fitting' than a 'probability-based' approach.

We have a [[science.stats.Regression.Loss Functions]]. The risk then is the 
expected loss of the model across the possible imputs. 

 At all points we consider a certain class of functions $\mathcal{H}$

# Examples of hypothesis classes

- Linear models [[science.stats.Regression.Linear Regression]]
- Linear models, but with nonlinear fixed feature expansions
- Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces ([[science.stats.Support Vector Machines]])
